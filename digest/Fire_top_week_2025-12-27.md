The author plans to work part-time in retirement, which could provide additional income and flexibility. The discussion highlights a divide between conservative and more flexible approaches to retirement withdrawals. While historical data suggests higher failure rates for a 5% withdrawal rate, many commenters emphasize the importance of adaptability and not strictly adhering to the 4% rule.
