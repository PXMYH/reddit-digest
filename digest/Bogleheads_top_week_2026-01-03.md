**Author:** u/DenimChickenTwin | **Upvotes:** 104 | **Comments:** 64 | **Date:** 2026-01-02

**Summary:** The author has $580,000 to invest and is deciding between keeping $180,000 in a high-yield savings account (HYSA) or investing it in a brokerage account while gradually moving it into retirement accounts over several years. The discussion highlights the trade-offs between potential market appreciation and tax implications.

**Key Points:**
- The author plans to invest $180,000 in tax-qualified retirement accounts and $400,000 in a brokerage account.
- The $180,000 will take several years to transfer due to annual contribution limits.
- The author is considering investing the $180,000 in the brokerage account while waiting to transfer it, despite capital gains taxes.

- Taxes on dividends and capital gains are unavoidable, but market appreciation may outweigh these costs.

**Discussion Highlights:** The consensus among commenters is that investing the $180,000 in a brokerage account alongside the $400,000 is better than keeping it in a HYSA.

## 2. [VTI or VOO is a choice that truly doesn’t matter. But the year is now 2026, and the S&amp;P 500 is a long-outdated investment for buy &amp; hold purposes.](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1q1fy9m/vti_or_voo_is_a_choice_that_truly_doesnt_matter/)

**Author:** u/Kashmir79 | **Upvotes:** 1409 | **Comments:** 272 | **Date:** 2026-01-01

- The discussion highlights a consensus that the choice between the two funds is not critical for long-term success.

**Discussion Highlights:** The top comments reinforce the post's argument, with one highly upvoted comment summarizing that the S&P 500's returns are statistically indistinguishable from the total market over time. Other comments humorously suggest expanding the discussion to include global funds like VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF).
