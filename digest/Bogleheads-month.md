## 35. [What so you think of Fidelity's "net worth targets" by age?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pqni6i/what_so_you_think_of_fidelitys_net_worth_targets/)

**Author:** u/HenFruitEater | **Upvotes:** 291 | **Comments:** 171 | **Date:** 2025-12-19

**Summary:** The Reddit post discusses Fidelity's age-based retirement savings benchmarks, comparing them to the FIRE community's 25x expenses rule. Users generally find Fidelity's targets reasonable but note they lack nuance and are based on norms like working until 65 and saving 15% of salary. Key points include: Fidelity's benchmarks are based on current salary and increase with age (1x by 30, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, 8x by 60, 10x by 67); the FIRE community's 25x expenses rule is aimed at early retirement, requiring a larger portfolio than Fidelity's targets; Fidelity's targets assume a standard retirement at 65 or later, with Social Security benefits; users agree the benchmarks are generic and may not apply to individual circumstances; current salary as a metric is criticized for not accounting for varying expenses. The consensus is that Fidelity's benchmarks are useful as general guidelines but lack personalization. Users highlight the differences between Fidelity's salary-based targets and the FIRE community's expense-based rule, noting that early retirement requires more savings.
