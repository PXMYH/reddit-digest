## 21. [VTI or VOO is a choice that truly doesn’t matter. But the year is now 2026, and the S&amp;P 500 is a long-outdated investment for buy &amp; hold purposes.](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1q1fy9m/vti_or_voo_is_a_choice_that_truly_doesnt_matter/)

**Author:** u/Kashmir79 | **Upvotes:** 1644 | **Comments:** 301 | **Date:** 2026-01-01

**Summary:** The post argues that the choice between VTI (total US market fund) and VOO (S&P 500 fund) is largely inconsequential for long-term investors, as both have historically delivered similar returns. The author provides a historical overview of the S&P 500 and emphasizes that the debate is often overblown. Key points include: The S&P 500 was originally created to broadly track the US stock market and has since become a standard benchmark. Both VTI and VOO have delivered statistically indistinguishable returns over the long term. The debate between VTI and VOO is considered tedious and overemphasized by many investors. The S&P 500 is often recommended by notable figures like Warren Buffett, but the total market fund (VTI) includes small caps, which some consider less significant. The choice between the two funds is unlikely to meaningfully impact an investor's long-term outcomes. The discussion consensus aligns with the post's argument, with top comments reinforcing that the choice between VTI and VOO is inconsequential. Some commenters humorously suggest expanding the discussion to include global funds like VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF).
