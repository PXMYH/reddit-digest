## 22. [VTI or VOO is a choice that truly doesn’t matter. But the year is now 2026, and the S&amp;P 500 is a long-outdated investment for buy &amp; hold purposes.](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1q1fy9m/vti_or_voo_is_a_choice_that_truly_doesnt_matter/)

**Author:** u/Kashmir79 | **Upvotes:** 1649 | **Comments:** 301 | **Date:** 2026-01-01

**Summary:** The post argues that the choice between VTI (Total US Market) and VOO (S&P 500) is inconsequential for long-term investors, as both funds deliver statistically similar returns. It provides historical context on the S&P 500's origins and critiques its continued dominance in investment discussions. Key points include: The S&P 500 was originally created as a practical sampling tool to approximate the total US stock market. Over nearly a century, the S&P 500 and total US market funds have delivered statistically indistinguishable returns.

The S&P 500's historical significance and Warren Buffett's endorsement contribute to its enduring popularity. Community consensus emphasizes that the choice between the two funds is less important than consistent investing. The top comments reinforce the post's argument, with one highly upvoted comment summarizing that the S&P 500's returns are statistically indistinguishable from the total market. Other comments humorously suggest expanding the discussion to include global funds like VT (Total World Market).
