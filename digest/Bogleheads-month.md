## 30. [What so you think of Fidelity's "net worth targets" by age?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pqni6i/what_so_you_think_of_fidelitys_net_worth_targets/)

**Author:** u/HenFruitEater | **Upvotes:** 296 | **Comments:** 171 | **Date:** 2025-12-19

**Summary:** The post discusses Fidelity's retirement savings targets by age, which are based on multiples of current salary, and compares them to the FIRE community's 25x expenses rule. The community generally finds the benchmarks useful as rules of thumb but notes they lack nuance and may not apply to everyone.

**Key Points:**
- Fidelity's benchmarks: By 30 (1x salary), By 40 (3x salary), By 50 (6x salary), By 60 (8x salary), By 67 (10x salary).
- Benchmarks are based on current salary, not net worth.
- FIRE community's 25x expenses rule is for early retirement, while Fidelity's targets are for standard retirement.
- The benchmarks are seen as useful but lack nuance and may not apply to everyone.
- Using current salary as a metric can be misleading for those with varying expenses.

**Discussion Highlights:** The community consensus is that Fidelity's benchmarks are fine as general guidelines but lack personalization. They are based on standard retirement at 65 or later, while the FIRE rule is for early retirement. The benchmarks are seen as a moving target to help people save adequately, but individual circumstances and goals vary widely.
