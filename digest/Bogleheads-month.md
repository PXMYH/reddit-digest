## 32. [Selling Everything Based on Fear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pvmu78/selling_everything_based_on_fear/)

**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 364 | **Comments:** 102 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The Reddit post compares a Buy-&-Hold investment strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings and moves into short-term treasuries when economic anxiety peaks, as measured by Google Trends for 'recession'. The analysis shows that while the Fear-Based strategy outperforms slightly in a tax-free scenario, the difference diminishes when accounting for capital gains tax, leading the author to conclude that staying invested is best.

- The Fear-Based strategy significantly reduces maximum drawdown compared to Buy-&-Hold.
- The author concludes that staying invested is best, especially for those decades from retirement.
- The Fear-Based strategy was back-tested using data from the same period it was developed, which may introduce bias.
- Timing the market based on fear is challenging and may not be feasible under real-world conditions.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights concerns about the back-testing methodology, the feasibility of implementing the Fear-Based strategy in real-time, and the impact of taxes on the strategy's performance.
