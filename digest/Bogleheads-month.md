## 28. [Selling Everything Based on Fear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pvmu78/selling_everything_based_on_fear/)

**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 368 | **Comments:** 104 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The Reddit post compares a Buy-&-Hold investment strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings when economic anxiety peaks (measured by Google trends for 'recession'). The analysis shows that while the Fear-Based strategy performs slightly better in a tax-free scenario, the difference is minimal, and the Buy-&-Hold strategy is more consistent and simpler to execute. Key points include the Fear-Based strategy outperforming Buy-&-Hold in a tax-free scenario but underperforming when accounting for capital gains tax, reducing maximum drawdown significantly but only marginally improving the Sharpe ratio, and the author concluding that staying invested and continuing to invest regularly is the best approach, especially for those decades from retirement. The discussion highlights skepticism about the practicality of the Fear-Based strategy, noting that it was back-tested using data from the same period it was developed. Commenters also question whether investors would have the discipline to execute such a strategy during turbulent market conditions. The consensus leans toward the simplicity and effectiveness of a Buy-&-Hold strategy.
