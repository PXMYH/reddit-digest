## 28. [Selling Everything Based on Fear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pvmu78/selling_everything_based_on_fear/)

**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 366 | **Comments:** 104 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The post compares a Buy-&-Hold strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings during high economic anxiety (measured by Google trends) and moves into short-term treasuries.

- The Fear-Based strategy significantly reduces the Max Drawdown compared to Buy-&-Hold.
- The strategy was back-tested using data from the same period it was developed, which may not be reliable for future performance.
- Implementing such a strategy in real-time requires strong psychological resilience and precise timing.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights concerns about the reliability of back-testing, the psychological challenges of implementing a fear-based strategy, and the importance of timing in such strategies. The consensus leans towards the benefits of staying invested and continuing to invest regularly.
