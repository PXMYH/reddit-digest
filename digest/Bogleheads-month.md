## 28. [Why do Bogleheads discourage use of AI search for investing information? Because it is too often wrong or misleading.](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1py0ajm/why_do_bogleheads_discourage_use_of_ai_search_for/)

The discussion highlights include instances where AI provided incorrect information about basic investment details, the preference for human opinions and experiences over algorithmic responses, and the unreliability of AI in professional contexts like accounting and legal language.
