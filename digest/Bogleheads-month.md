## 1. [How do you contribute exactly the 401K limit?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qc0nzt/how_do_you_contribute_exactly_the_401k_limit/)

**Author:** u/fungus_among_us_art | **Upvotes:** 210 | **Comments:** 95 | **Date:** 2026-01-13

**Summary:** The post discusses strategies for contributing exactly the $24,500 limit to a 401K plan, considering employer matching and variable bonuses. Users share tips on how to manage contributions to avoid missing out on employer matches. Key points include: Employer contributions do not count toward the $24,500 limit. Some employers offer 'true up' to compensate for missed matches if contributions are slightly overshot. Without 'true up,' periodic adjustments are needed to hit the contribution limit accurately. Payroll systems may automatically cap contributions at the federal limit. Calculating contributions based on pay periods can help in reaching the limit. The discussion highlights the importance of understanding employer policies like 'true up' and the need for periodic adjustments if such policies are not available. Users agree that employer contributions are separate from the federal limit and suggest practical methods like dividing the limit by pay periods to manage contributions effectively.
