**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 363 | **Comments:** 102 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The Reddit post compares a Buy-&-Hold strategy with a Fear-Based strategy for investing in SPY over 22 years.

- The post concludes that staying invested and continuing to invest is the best strategy for someone decades from retirement.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights concerns about the practicality of the Fear-Based strategy, including the challenge of market timing and the psychological difficulty of executing trades during turbulent conditions.
