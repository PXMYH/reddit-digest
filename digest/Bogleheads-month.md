- Policies against AI-generated content are not a commentary on AI's overall value but focus on its appropriateness for providing substantive investing advice.
- Real-world examples from comments show instances where AI provided incorrect information, such as wrong expense ratios for index funds.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights a consensus that while AI can be a powerful tool, it is not suitable for providing reliable investing advice due to its inherent limitations.
