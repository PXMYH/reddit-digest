## 30. [Selling Everything Based on Fear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pvmu78/selling_everything_based_on_fear/)

**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 361 | **Comments:** 102 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The Reddit post compares a Buy-&-Hold strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings when economic anxiety peaks (measured by Google trends for 'recession') and moves into short-term treasuries.

The discussion highlights concerns about the practicality of the Fear-Based strategy, including the challenge of timing the market accurately and the emotional difficulty of executing such a strategy during turbulent times.
