## 32. [What so you think of Fidelity's "net worth targets" by age?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pqni6i/what_so_you_think_of_fidelitys_net_worth_targets/)

**Author:** u/HenFruitEater | **Upvotes:** 295 | **Comments:** 171 | **Date:** 2025-12-19

**Summary:** The post discusses Fidelity's retirement savings targets by age, comparing them to the FIRE community's 25x expenses rule. The discussion highlights that Fidelity's benchmarks are generic rules of thumb based on standard retirement assumptions.

- Discussion highlights the lack of nuance in Fidelity's targets and the importance of individual circumstances.

**Discussion Highlights:** The consensus is that Fidelity's targets are fine as general guidelines but lack nuance.
