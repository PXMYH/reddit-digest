## 29. [Selling Everything Based on Fear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pvmu78/selling_everything_based_on_fear/)

**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 363 | **Comments:** 102 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The post compares a Buy-&-Hold strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings when economic anxiety peaks (measured by Google trends for 'recession') and moves into short-term treasuries. The analysis shows that while the Fear-Based strategy outperforms slightly in a tax-free scenario, the difference is minimal, and after accounting for taxes, the Buy-&-Hold strategy is more beneficial.

- The Fear-Based strategy outperforms Buy-&-Hold in a tax-free scenario but underperforms after taxes.
- The Fear-Based strategy reduces max drawdown significantly but has minimal impact on annual returns.
- The strategy is back-tested using data from the same period it was developed, which may not be reliable for future performance.
- Timing the market based on fear is challenging and may not be feasible under real-world conditions.
- The consensus among commenters is that staying invested is generally better than trying to time the market.

**Discussion Highlights:** Commenters highlight the limitations of back-testing strategies using the same data they were developed on and question the feasibility of executing such strategies in real-time. There is a general consensus that staying invested and avoiding market timing is a more reliable approach.
