## 17. [VTI or VOO is a choice that truly doesn’t matter. But the year is now 2026, and the S&amp;P 500 is a long-outdated investment for buy &amp; hold purposes.](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1q1fy9m/vti_or_voo_is_a_choice_that_truly_doesnt_matter/)

**Author:** u/Kashmir79 | **Upvotes:** 1619 | **Comments:** 301 | **Date:** 2026-01-01

The discussion consensus aligns with the post's argument, emphasizing that the choice between VTI and VOO is inconsequential. Top comments reinforce this, with one noting that the S&P 500's returns are statistically indistinguishable from the total market.
