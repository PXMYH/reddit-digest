## 30. [Selling Everything Based on Fear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pvmu78/selling_everything_based_on_fear/)

**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 364 | **Comments:** 102 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The Reddit post compares a Buy-&-Hold strategy with a Fear-Based strategy for investing in SPY over 22 years.
