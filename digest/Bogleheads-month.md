## 27. [What so you think of Fidelity's "net worth targets" by age?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pqni6i/what_so_you_think_of_fidelitys_net_worth_targets/)

**Author:** u/HenFruitEater | **Upvotes:** 301 | **Comments:** 171 | **Date:** 2025-12-19

**Summary:** The Reddit post discusses Fidelity's age-based retirement savings benchmarks, which suggest saving 1x salary by 30, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, 8x by 60, and 10x by 67. The discussion compares these targets with the FIRE community's 25x expenses rule and debates their applicability and optimism. Key points include: Fidelity's benchmarks are based on current salary and assume a standard retirement age of 65 or later; the FIRE community's 25x expenses rule is aimed at early retirement and requires a larger portfolio; Fidelity's targets are seen as general guidelines lacking nuance but useful as rules of thumb; current salary as a metric may not be ideal for those with varying expenses or income levels; the benchmarks assume a savings rate of around 15% and a typical working period from 21 to 65. The consensus is that Fidelity's benchmarks are reasonable for standard retirement planning but may not apply to everyone due to individual circumstances. The FIRE community's 25x expenses rule is more aggressive and suited for early retirement. Users acknowledge the lack of nuance in Fidelity's targets but find them useful as general guidelines.
