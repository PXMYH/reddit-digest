## 31. [Selling Everything Based on Fear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pvmu78/selling_everything_based_on_fear/)

**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 367 | **Comments:** 102 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The Reddit post compares a Buy-&-Hold strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings when economic anxiety peaks (measured by Google trends for 'recession'). The analysis shows that while the Fear-Based strategy performs slightly better in a tax-free scenario, the difference is minimal, and the Buy-&-Hold strategy outperforms when taxes are considered.

**Key Points:**

- In a tax-free scenario, the Fear-Based strategy yields a slightly higher total return and CAGR but significantly reduces the max drawdown.
- When accounting for a 15% capital gains tax, the Buy-&-Hold strategy outperforms the Fear-Based strategy in total return and CAGR.
- The discussion highlights concerns about back-testing bias and the practical challenges of implementing a fear-based strategy in real-time.
- The consensus leans towards the Buy-&-Hold strategy being more reliable and less stressful for long-term investors.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion emphasizes the potential pitfalls of back-testing strategies based on recent data and the difficulty of executing fear-based strategies under real market conditions.
