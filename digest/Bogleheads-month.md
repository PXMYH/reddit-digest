## 31. [What so you think of Fidelity's "net worth targets" by age?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pqni6i/what_so_you_think_of_fidelitys_net_worth_targets/)

**Author:** u/HenFruitEater | **Upvotes:** 292 | **Comments:** 171 | **Date:** 2025-12-19

**Summary:** The Reddit post discusses Fidelity's age-based retirement savings benchmarks, which suggest saving 1x salary by 30, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, 8x by 60, and 10x by 67. The discussion compares these targets with the FIRE community's 25x expenses rule and debates their applicability and nuances. Key points include: Fidelity's benchmarks are based on current salary and are intended for standard retirement at 65 or later; the FIRE community's 25x expenses rule is aimed at early retirement and requires a larger portfolio; Fidelity's targets are seen as generic and lack nuance, but are useful as rules of thumb; current salary as a metric may not be ideal for everyone, especially those with varying expenses; the benchmarks assume a savings rate of around 15% and a typical working period from 21 to 65. The consensus is that Fidelity's benchmarks are a useful starting point but lack personalization. They are based on norms and assume a standard retirement age and savings rate. The FIRE community's 25x expenses rule is more aggressive and aimed at early retirement. Users agree that individual circumstances and goals should be considered when applying these benchmarks.
