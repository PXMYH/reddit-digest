## 2. [Selling Everything Based on Fear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pvmu78/selling_everything_based_on_fear/)

**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 333 | **Comments:** 94 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The Reddit post compares a Buy-&-Hold strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings when economic anxiety peaks (measured by Google Trends for 'recession'). The analysis shows that while the Fear-Based strategy slightly outperforms in a tax-free scenario, the difference is minimal, and taxes significantly reduce its advantage. The author concludes that staying invested is best for long-term investors.

**Key Points:**
- The Fear-Based strategy slightly outperforms Buy-&-Hold in a tax-free scenario but underperforms after taxes.
- The Fear-Based strategy reduces max drawdown but has lower returns after accounting for taxes.
- The strategy is back-tested using data from the same period it was developed, which may not reflect future performance.
- Timing the market is difficult, and the strategy assumes perfect execution, which may not be realistic.
- The consensus is that staying invested and avoiding market timing is generally better for long-term investors.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights concerns about back-testing bias, the difficulty of timing the market in real-time, and the impact of taxes on the Fear-Based strategy. The consensus leans towards the Buy-&-Hold strategy being more reliable for long-term investing.
