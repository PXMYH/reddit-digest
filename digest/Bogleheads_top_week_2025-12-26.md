## 1. [Selling Everything Based on Fear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pvmu78/selling_everything_based_on_fear/)

**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 291 | **Comments:** 91 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The Reddit post compares a Buy-&-Hold investment strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings when economic anxiety peaks (measured by Google trends for 'recession') and moves into short-term treasuries. The analysis shows that while the Fear-Based strategy performs slightly better in a tax-free scenario, the difference in annual returns is minimal, and the Buy-&-Hold strategy outperforms when considering capital gains taxes.

**Key Points:**
- The Fear-Based strategy outperforms Buy-&-Hold in a tax-free scenario but underperforms when considering capital gains taxes.
- The difference in annual returns between the two strategies is less than 1% in a tax-free account.
- The Fear-Based strategy significantly reduces maximum drawdown compared to Buy-&-Hold.
- The analysis is based on back-testing over the same period used to develop the strategy, which may introduce bias.
- The practical implementation of the Fear-Based strategy is challenging due to timing and emotional factors.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights concerns about the back-testing bias in the Fear-Based strategy and the emotional challenges of implementing such a strategy in real-time. There is a consensus that while the Fear-Based strategy shows some benefits, the practical difficulties and minimal return differences make Buy-&-Hold a more reliable approach for long-term investors.
