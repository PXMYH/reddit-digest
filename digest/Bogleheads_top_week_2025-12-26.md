## 1. [Selling Everything Based on Fear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pvmu78/selling_everything_based_on_fear/)

**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 312 | **Comments:** 94 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The post compares a Buy-&-Hold strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings when economic anxiety peaks (measured by Google trends for 'recession') and moves into short-term treasuries. The analysis shows that while the Fear-Based strategy performs slightly better in a tax-free scenario, the difference is minimal, and the Buy-&-Hold strategy outperforms when taxes are considered.

**Key Points:**
- The Fear-Based strategy outperforms Buy-&-Hold in a tax-free scenario but underperforms when taxes are considered.
- The Fear-Based strategy reduces max drawdown significantly compared to Buy-&-Hold.
- The strategy is back-tested using data from the same period it was developed, which may introduce bias.
- Timing the market based on fear is challenging and may not be feasible for all investors.
- The difference in annual returns between the two strategies is less than 1% in a tax-free account.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights concerns about the back-testing methodology, the feasibility of implementing such a strategy in real-time, and the impact of taxes on the Fear-Based strategy. There is a consensus that while the Fear-Based strategy shows some benefits, the practical challenges and minimal performance difference make Buy-&-Hold a more reliable approach for most investors.
