**Author:** u/tryingmybesttolearn2 | **Upvotes:** 131 | **Comments:** 70 | **Date:** 2025-12-14

**Summary:** The post discusses a 33-year-old's interest in using VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) for their portfolio outside of their TSP, which is fully invested in the S&P 500.

- Some comments highlight the need to consider the overall portfolio allocation, including the TSP.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights a strong consensus around VT as a simple and effective solution for global diversification. However, some users caution about potential US overweight due to the user's TSP allocation and suggest alternatives like VTI and VXUS to achieve a more balanced portfolio.
