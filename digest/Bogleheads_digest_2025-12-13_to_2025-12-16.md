**Author:** u/tryingmybesttolearn2 | **Upvotes:** 132 | **Comments:** 60 | **Date:** 2025-12-14

**Summary:** The post discusses a 33-year-old investor's interest in using VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) for their portfolio outside of their TSP, which is fully invested in the S&P 500.

**Key Points:**

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion largely supports VT as a comprehensive and simple solution for global equity exposure. However, some commenters note the potential for US market overweight due to the user's existing S&P 500 investment and suggest alternatives like VTI and VXUS to achieve a more balanced portfolio.
