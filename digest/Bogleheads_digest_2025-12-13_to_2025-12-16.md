## 2. [VT and Chill?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pmrbbp/vt_and_chill/)

**Author:** u/tryingmybesttolearn2 | **Upvotes:** 130 | **Comments:** 62 | **Date:** 2025-12-14

**Summary:** The post discusses the suitability of VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) as a comprehensive investment option, with the author seeking advice on whether additional ETFs are necessary. The comments largely support VT as a standalone investment, emphasizing its simplicity and broad market coverage.

**Key Points:**
- VT is designed to be a one-stop shop for total domestic and international index investing.
- Adding more equity-tracking ETFs on top of VT is generally discouraged.
- VT and chill is considered a simple and effective investment strategy.
- The author's existing S&P 500 investment in TSP may lead to an overweight in US stocks if VT is added.
- An alternative approach could involve using VTI and VXUS to approximate VT's allocation.

**Discussion Highlights:** The consensus in the discussion supports VT as a comprehensive and simple investment option. However, some commenters note the potential for US stock overweight if the author already has significant S&P 500 exposure. Alternatives like VTI and VXUS are suggested for more customized allocations.
