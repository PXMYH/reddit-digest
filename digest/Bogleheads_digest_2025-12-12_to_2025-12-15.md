## 2. [VT and Chill?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pmrbbp/vt_and_chill/)

**Author:** u/tryingmybesttolearn2 | **Upvotes:** 106 | **Comments:** 55 | **Date:** 2025-12-14

**Summary:** The post discusses the suitability of VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) as a comprehensive investment option, with the author seeking advice on whether to include other ETFs. The comments largely support VT as a one-stop solution, though some suggest alternatives like VTI and VXUS for better balancing US and international exposure.

**Key Points:**
- VT is praised as a comprehensive, all-in-one ETF for global equity exposure.
- The consensus is to stick with VT alone if opting for a simple, diversified portfolio.
- Some commenters suggest using VTI (US) and VXUS (international) to balance the author's existing S&P 500-heavy TSP.
- The author's current TSP allocation (all S&P 500) may lead to US overweight if VT is added.
- Alternatives like target-date funds are mentioned as even simpler options.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights strong support for VT as a 'chill' investment strategy, with many commenters endorsing it as a standalone solution. However, there is also a notable consideration for balancing US and international exposure, especially given the author's existing S&P 500-heavy TSP. Alternatives like VTI and VXUS are suggested for those who prefer more control over their US vs. international allocation.
