## 2. [VT and Chill?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pmrbbp/vt_and_chill/)

**Author:** u/tryingmybesttolearn2 | **Upvotes:** 116 | **Comments:** 56 | **Date:** 2025-12-14

**Summary:** The post discusses the suitability of VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) for a 33-year-old investor looking to diversify outside their TSP, which is fully invested in the S&P 500. The comments generally support VT as a comprehensive, one-stop solution for global equity exposure.

**Key Points:**
- VT is praised as a comprehensive, one-stop ETF for global equity exposure.
- Adding more equity-tracking ETFs alongside VT is discouraged.
- The user's existing S&P 500 holdings may lead to an overweight in US equities if VT is added.
- Alternatives like VTI (US) and VXUS (international) are suggested to balance the portfolio.
- VT is considered a low-maintenance option, similar to a target-date fund.

**Discussion Highlights:** The consensus supports VT as a simple and effective solution for global diversification. However, some commenters caution about potential US equity overweight due to the user's existing S&P 500 holdings and suggest balancing with VTI and VXUS.
