## 6. [Vanguard Final Estimated Year-End 2025 Distributions](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pod994/vanguard_final_estimated_yearend_2025/)

**Author:** u/EevelBob | **Upvotes:** 190 | **Comments:** 21 | **Date:** 2025-12-16

**Summary:** The post discusses Vanguard's final estimated year-end 2025 distributions, explaining that mutual fund NAV decreases by the exact amount of the dividend or distribution paid out on the ex-dividend date.
