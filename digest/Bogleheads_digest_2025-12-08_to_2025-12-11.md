## 1. ### [401(k)s Are Minting a Generation of ‘Moderate Millionaires’](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1phijlw/401ks_are_minting_a_generation_of_moderate/)

**Author:** u/Str8truth | **Upvotes:** 1305 | **Comments:** 470 | **Date:** 2025-12-08

**Summary:** The Reddit post discusses the increasing number of 401(k) accounts reaching $1 million, highlighting that while the percentage has doubled in three years, it remains relatively low. The discussion emphasizes the impact of inflation and market conditions on perceived wealth.

**Key Points:**
- Approximately 3% of 401(k) accounts are now $1 million+, up from 1.5% three years ago.
- Despite being millionaires, many still practice frugality due to inflation and lifestyle costs.
- The perception of wealth is skewed by inflation; $3.3 million today would be equivalent to $1 million in the 1980s.
- Market performance (e.g., 20% YTD gains) significantly impacts the number of millionaire accounts.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights a consensus that while the number of millionaire 401(k) accounts is growing, inflation and market volatility mean this wealth doesn't translate to the lavish lifestyles often associated with millionaire status. Many commenters emphasize the importance of context, such as inflation and market corrections, in understanding these figures.

## 3. ### [Will it ever matter or make a difference if you choose the total stock market index vs s&amp;p500?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pio24y/will_it_ever_matter_or_make_a_difference_if_you/)

**Author:** u/sethh27 | **Upvotes:** 426 | **Comments:** 128 | **Date:** 2025-12-09

**Summary:** The post discusses whether choosing the Total Stock Market Index (TSM) over the S&P 500 makes a significant difference. While TSM offers added diversification, historical data shows minimal performance differences, and the choice often depends on practical implementation and personal preference. Key points include broader diversification with TSM, minimal historical performance differences, practical implementation arguments, the S&P 500's design to sample the total US market, and tax-loss harvesting benefits. The discussion highlights that while TSM offers theoretical diversification benefits, the practical differences in performance are often negligible, with consensus leaning toward personal preference and practical considerations.
