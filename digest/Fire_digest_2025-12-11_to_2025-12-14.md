## 1. [FIRE is still obscure to most](https://reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1pln93p/fire_is_still_obscure_to_most/)

**Author:** u/WhalerGuy90 | **Upvotes:** 748 | **Comments:** 284 | **Date:** 2025-12-13

**Summary:** The Reddit post highlights that the concept of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) is still obscure to most people, as evidenced by a colleague's surprise at their boss retiring in his late 30s. The discussion emphasizes the lack of awareness about the power of compounding and saving a significant portion of income. Key points include: FIRE is not widely known outside certain circles like tech and finance; many people are unaware of the benefits of compounding and saving 20-25% of their income; retiring in one's late 30s is considered outside the norm for most people; financial literacy and interest in early retirement vary widely among individuals; and spreading awareness about FIRE can potentially change lives. The discussion reveals a consensus that FIRE is not well-known among the general population, with many people focusing on living in the present rather than planning for early retirement. There is also an acknowledgment that financial literacy and the ability to save significantly vary among individuals.
