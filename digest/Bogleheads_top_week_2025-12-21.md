## 2. [What so you think of Fidelity's "net worth targets" by age?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pqni6i/what_so_you_think_of_fidelitys_net_worth_targets/)

**Author:** u/HenFruitEater | **Upvotes:** 283 | **Comments:** 167 | **Date:** 2025-12-19

**Summary:** The post discusses Fidelity's retirement savings targets by age, comparing them to the FIRE community's 25x expenses rule. The benchmarks suggest saving 1x salary by 30, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, 8x by 60, and 10x by 67. The discussion highlights the differences and nuances between these approaches. Key points include: Fidelity's benchmarks are based on current salary and aim for a standard retirement at 65 or later; the FIRE community's 25x expenses rule is designed for early retirement and requires a larger portfolio; Fidelity's targets are seen as a general guideline lacking nuance but useful as a rule of thumb; current salary as a metric may not be ideal for everyone, especially those with varying expenses; the benchmarks assume a savings rate of around 15% and a typical working period from 21 to 65. The consensus is that Fidelity's benchmarks are a useful but generic guideline for standard retirement planning. They are not directly applicable to everyone due to individual circumstances and goals. The FIRE community's 25x expenses rule is more aggressive and aimed at early retirement, requiring a larger portfolio due to the longer retirement period.
