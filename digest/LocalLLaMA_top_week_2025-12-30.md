## 30. [All of the major open weight labs have shifted to large params general models instead of smaller, more focused models. By this time next year, there won’t be much “local” about this sub unless the paradigm shifts to smaller models good at specific domains.](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pv2cnz/all_of_the_major_open_weight_labs_have_shifted_to/)

**Author:** u/LocoMod | **Upvotes:** 234 | **Comments:** 243 | **Date:** 2025-12-24

**Summary:** The post discusses a shift in open weight labs towards larger, general models, making it harder for local users to run them without high-end hardware. The author calls for a return to smaller, domain-specific models that can be run locally with limited resources.

**Key Points:**
- Open weight labs are increasingly focusing on large, general models that require significant hardware resources.
- Many users are resorting to lower-quality quantized versions of these models due to hardware limitations.
- The author advocates for a return to smaller, domain-specific models that can be run locally with 16-32GB of VRAM.
- Recent releases like Mistral's 14B models and Qwen3's smaller models are noted as exceptions to this trend.
- There is a debate in the comments about the feasibility of returning to smaller models and the role of big companies in shaping the landscape.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights a divide between the trend towards larger models and the community's desire for smaller, more accessible models. Some commenters point to recent releases of smaller models as counterexamples, while others question the feasibility of reversing the trend without support from major companies.

## 32. [We asked OSS-120B and GLM 4.6 to play 1,408 Civilization V games from the Stone Age into the future. Here's what we found.](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pux0yc/we_asked_oss120b_and_glm_46_to_play_1408/)

**Author:** u/vox-deorum | **Upvotes:** 625 | **Comments:** 156 | **Date:** 2025-12-24

**Summary:** Researchers used open-source LLMs (GPT-OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) to play 1,408 full games of Civilization V with Vox Populi. The LLMs showed slightly better best scores but slightly worse win rates compared to the baseline AI. Notably, the LLMs developed distinct playstyles and could survive full games, a feat previously unattainable with pure-LLM or pure-RL approaches. Key points include: LLMs played 1,408 full Civilization V games with Vox Populi, showing slightly better best scores but slightly worse win rates. The hybrid approach allowed LLMs to survive full games, unlike previous pure-LLM or pure-RL methods. OSS-120B favored a warmonger playstyle with more Domination victories, while GLM-4.6 played more balanced. Both models preferred the Order ideology (communist-like) over Freedom (democratic-like). The cost per game was approximately $0.86 for OSS-120B, with input tokens scaling linearly as the game progressed. The discussion highlights enthusiasm for the potential of LLMs in gaming, with users expressing interest in playing against local models and integrating these AIs into multiplayer games. Some users also inquired about the impact of model size on performance and the possibility of treating the game as quasi-multi-level ABMs.
