## 27. [We asked OSS-120B and GLM 4.6 to play 1,408 Civilization V games from the Stone Age into the future. Here's what we found.](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pux0yc/we_asked_oss120b_and_glm_46_to_play_1408/)

**Author:** u/vox-deorum | **Upvotes:** 624 | **Comments:** 156 | **Date:** 2025-12-24

**Summary:** Researchers used open-source LLMs (GPT-OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) to play 1,408 full Civilization V games, finding that LLMs can survive full games with a hybrid approach and develop distinct playstyles. The models showed slight performance improvements but no significant advantage over the in-game AI. Key points include: LLMs can survive full Civilization V games with a hybrid approach, achieving ~97.5% survival rate; OSS-120B favored a warmonger playstyle with more Domination victories, while GLM-4.6 played more balanced; Both models preferred the Order ideology (~24% more likely) over Freedom; Cost per game was ~$0.86 for OSS-120B, with input tokens scaling linearly as the game progresses; The study suggests that even smaller models (e.g., OSS-20B) can perform adequately. The community expressed excitement about the potential for LLMs to enhance gameplay, with interest in integrating them into multiplayer games. Some users questioned the impact of model size on performance and explored the idea of treating the game as a multi-level agent-based model.
