**Author:** u/dudreddit | **Upvotes:** 474 | **Comments:** 130 | **Date:** 2025-12-10

**Summary:** The post discusses how contributions to wealth become less impactful over time, particularly after reaching around $500K or year 15 of investing. The video linked highlights the shift from contribution-driven growth to compounding-driven growth.

**Key Points:**
- Contributions are crucial in the early years but become less significant as compounding takes over.
- After reaching a certain threshold (~$500K), the impact of additional contributions diminishes.
- The trade-off between working longer for higher spending vs. retiring earlier is a key discussion point.
- Some commenters suggest that reducing contributions after reaching a comfortable level can be a viable strategy.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights the importance of early contributions and the eventual dominance of compounding. There is a consensus that while contributions matter less over time, they are critical in the early stages of wealth accumulation. The trade-offs between working longer and retiring earlier are also a significant point of discussion.

## 2. [Will it ever matter or make a difference if you choose the total stock market index vs s&amp;p500?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pio24y/will_it_ever_matter_or_make_a_difference_if_you/)

**Author:** u/sethh27 | **Upvotes:** 437 | **Comments:** 132 | **Date:** 2025-12-09

**Summary:** The post discusses the differences and potential benefits of choosing a total stock market index fund over an S&P 500 fund, questioning whether the added diversification has historically provided value. The discussion highlights varying perspectives on the practical implications and theoretical advantages of each index.

**Key Points:**
- The total stock market index offers added diversification compared to the S&P 500.
- Historical data on the total stock market index is limited, making long-term comparisons difficult.
- Some argue that the total market fund is a more practical implementation of indexing theory.
- The S&P 500 was designed to track the total US market using a sampling methodology.
- In major downturns, swapping between these funds can help with tax-loss harvesting while avoiding wash sale rules.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion reveals a mix of opinions, with some favoring the total market index for its broader diversification and theoretical alignment with indexing principles, while others see minimal practical differences between the two. There is a consensus that both are strong investment options, with the choice potentially depending on individual preferences and specific financial strategies like tax-loss harvesting.
