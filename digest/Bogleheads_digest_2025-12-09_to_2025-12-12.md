## 2. [Will it ever matter or make a difference if you choose the total stock market index vs s&amp;p500?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pio24y/will_it_ever_matter_or_make_a_difference_if_you/)

**Author:** u/sethh27 | **Upvotes:** 439 | **Comments:** 130 | **Date:** 2025-12-09

**Summary:** The post discusses the differences and potential benefits of choosing a total stock market index fund over an S&P 500 index fund. While both are considered strong investment options, the discussion highlights nuances in diversification and practical implementation. Key points include: The total stock market index offers added diversification compared to the S&P 500. Historical data shows minimal performance differences between the two indexes. Some investors prefer the total market fund for its broader representation of the U.S. market. The S&P 500 is not considered inferior but may be less diversified than the total market index. Tax-loss harvesting strategies can benefit from switching between these two indexes. The consensus suggests that while the total stock market index may offer slight diversification benefits, the performance difference between the two is often negligible. Investors are encouraged to choose based on personal preference and practical considerations like tax strategies.
