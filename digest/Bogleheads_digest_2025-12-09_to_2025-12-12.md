- The psychological challenge of seeing contributions grow can be addressed by starting fresh.
- The 'first $100k is the hardest' due to the compounding effect becoming significant.

- Some argue that the total market fund is a more practical implementation of indexing theory.
- The S&P 500 was designed to track the total US market using a sampling methodology.
- In major downturns, switching between these indexes can be useful for tax-loss harvesting.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion reveals a mix of opinions, with some favoring the total market index for its broader diversification and alignment with indexing theory, while others see minimal practical differences between the two. There is a consensus that both are strong investment options, with the choice potentially depending on individual preferences and specific financial strategies like tax-loss harvesting.
