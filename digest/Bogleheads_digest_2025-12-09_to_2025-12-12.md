**Summary:** The post discusses the differences and potential benefits of choosing a total stock market index fund versus an S&P 500 index fund, questioning whether the added diversification of the total market index has historically provided any significant value.

**Key Points:**
- The total stock market index offers added diversification compared to the S&P 500.
- Historical data shows minimal difference in performance between the two indexes.
- Some investors prefer the total market index for its broader representation of the US market.
- The S&P 500 is not considered inferior but may be less diversified.
- Tax-loss harvesting strategies can benefit from switching between the two indexes.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights that while the total stock market index offers broader diversification, the practical differences in performance may be minimal. Some commenters suggest that the total market index is a more obvious practical implementation of indexing theory, while others note that the S&P 500 has historically been a strong performer. There is also mention of using both indexes for tax-loss harvesting strategies.
