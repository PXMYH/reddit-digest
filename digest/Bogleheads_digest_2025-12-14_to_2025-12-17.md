## 2. [VT and Chill?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pmrbbp/vt_and_chill/)

**Author:** u/tryingmybesttolearn2 | **Upvotes:** 135 | **Comments:** 71 | **Date:** 2025-12-14

**Summary:** The Reddit post discusses the user's interest in VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) as a one-stop solution for their portfolio outside of their TSP, which is entirely invested in the S&P 500. The comments largely support the 'VT and chill' approach, emphasizing its simplicity and comprehensiveness. Key points include: VT is designed to be a one-stop shop for total domestic and international index investing; the 'VT and chill' approach is widely supported as a simple and effective strategy; the user's TSP being entirely in the S&P 500 may lead to an overweight in US stocks if VT is added; some commenters suggest using VTI and VXUS to approximate VT while balancing the US overweight; VT is considered the ultimate chill strategy, similar to a target date fund. The discussion highlights a strong consensus around the 'VT and chill' approach, with many commenters endorsing VT as a comprehensive and simple solution. However, there is also a consideration for balancing the user's portfolio to avoid an overweight in US stocks due to their TSP investment in the S&P 500. Some commenters suggest using a combination of VTI and VXUS to achieve a similar balance to VT while addressing the US overweight.
