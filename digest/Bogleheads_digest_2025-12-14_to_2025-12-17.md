**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights a strong consensus around VT as a comprehensive and simple investment solution. Commenters emphasize that VT is designed to be a standalone ETF for global equity exposure, and additional ETFs are generally unnecessary. However, some suggest balancing US and international exposure with VTI and VXUS if the author's existing S&P 500 investment is significant.
