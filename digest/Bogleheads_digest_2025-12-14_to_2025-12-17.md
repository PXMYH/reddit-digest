## 2. [Inflation adjusted market returns do not look all that rosy. Am I missing something?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1po0c1o/inflation_adjusted_market_returns_do_not_look_all/)

**Author:** u/volchonok1 | **Upvotes:** 176 | **Comments:** 230 | **Date:** 2025-12-16

**Summary:** The author questions the effectiveness of long-term investing in the S&P 500 due to observed periods of flat or negative inflation-adjusted returns, expressing concern about future market performance and the practicality of compounding interest.

**Key Points:**
- Inflation-adjusted S&P 500 returns show extended periods of flat or negative performance (e.g., 1968-1994, 2000-2016, 1930-1950).
- Market growth appears concentrated in specific periods (e.g., 1950-1970, mid-1980s-2000, 2013-present).
- The author suggests that significant gains require investing during growth periods or holding investments for very long durations (30+ years).
- Dividends and diversification are highlighted as critical factors in assessing true returns.
- The discussion emphasizes comparing stock returns to alternative strategies for beating inflation.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion consensus underscores the importance of considering dividends and diversification in evaluating market returns. Many commenters argue that stocks remain a viable option for beating inflation compared to alternatives, and they stress the need for a long-term, diversified investment approach.

## 3. [VT and Chill?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pmrbbp/vt_and_chill/)

**Author:** u/tryingmybesttolearn2 | **Upvotes:** 134 | **Comments:** 72 | **Date:** 2025-12-14

**Summary:** The post discusses the suitability of VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) as a standalone investment for a 33-year-old with an S&P 500-heavy TSP portfolio. The discussion highlights the simplicity of a 'VT and chill' approach but also notes potential US market overweight concerns.

**Key Points:**
- VT is designed as a one-stop shop for global equity exposure
- Adding more equity ETFs alongside VT may be redundant
- Potential US market overweight if combining S&P 500 TSP with VT
- Alternative approach: VTI (US) + VXUS (International) to balance exposure
- VT and chill is considered a simple, effective strategy

**Discussion Highlights:** The consensus leans toward VT as a simple, effective solution for global diversification, though some suggest balancing US/international exposure more precisely given the author's existing S&P 500 holdings. The 'VT and chill' approach is widely endorsed for its simplicity.
