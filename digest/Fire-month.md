## 30. [Do you believe the modern FIRE movement overestimates how much is needed for retirement?](https://reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1pxsnhb/do_you_believe_the_modern_fire_movement/)

**Author:** u/Equivalent_Use_5024 | **Upvotes:** 747 | **Comments:** 894 | **Date:** 2025-12-28

**Summary:** The Reddit post questions whether the FIRE movement overestimates retirement savings needs, noting that many in the movement feel behind with substantial savings (e.g., $500k at 30 or $1.5M at 40), while average Americans retire with less and manage with social security or paid-off housing. The discussion highlights differing perspectives on what constitutes a 'safe' retirement versus a luxurious one. Key points include: The FIRE movement often targets higher savings goals (e.g., $1M+) for early retirement, contrasting with average American retirement savings (~$300k). Some argue FIRE goals are based on luxury rather than necessity, with withdrawal rates often below 4%. Early retirement (e.g., at 50) requires more savings than traditional retirement (e.g., at 65) due to longer time horizons. Cost of living (COL) and lifestyle expectations significantly impact retirement needs. The discussion suggests a divide between 'safe' retirement (basic needs met) and 'comfortable' retirement (luxury lifestyle). The consensus leans toward acknowledging that FIRE goals are often higher due to early retirement and lifestyle aspirations, but some argue these estimates may be inflated for those prioritizing basic financial security over luxury. Key factors like withdrawal rates, COL, and retirement age are emphasized as critical in determining individual needs.
