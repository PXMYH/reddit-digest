**Author:** u/Equivalent_Use_5024 | **Upvotes:** 744 | **Comments:** 893 | **Date:** 2025-12-28

Many commenters agree that FIRE calculations are tailored to individual spending goals rather than universal benchmarks, and that early retirement requires more savings than traditional retirement due to longer time horizons and lack of social security benefits.
