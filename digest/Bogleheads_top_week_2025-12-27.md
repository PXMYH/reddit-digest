## 1. [What if you need cash during a market crash?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pw1vyy/what_if_you_need_cash_during_a_market_crash/)

**Author:** u/Own_Active_2147 | **Upvotes:** 154 | **Comments:** 144 | **Date:** 2025-12-26

**Summary:** The post discusses concerns about needing cash during a market crash, particularly if facing job loss and health issues. The discussion emphasizes the importance of an emergency fund and not investing money needed in the short term. Key points include: Importance of having an emergency fund (6-12 months of expenses), only invest money that can be left untouched for 5-10 years, emergency funds should be kept in easily accessible, low-risk accounts like HYSA or CDs, health and life insurance are also important safety nets, and historically, markets recover over time, making long-term investing viable. The consensus in the comments highlights the critical role of an emergency fund as a financial safety net during market downturns. Commenters agree that short-term needs should be covered by liquid savings rather than investments, and that long-term investing in index funds remains a sound strategy despite market volatility.

## 2. [Selling Everything Based on Fear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pvmu78/selling_everything_based_on_fear/)

**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 354 | **Comments:** 98 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The Reddit post compares a Buy-&-Hold strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings when economic anxiety peaks (measured by Google trends for 'recession'). The analysis shows that while the Fear-Based strategy outperforms slightly in a tax-free scenario, the difference diminishes when accounting for taxes, leading the author to conclude that staying invested is better for long-term growth. Key points include the use of Google trends for 'recession' to trigger selling, the performance difference in tax-free vs. taxable scenarios, and the author's conclusion favoring staying invested. The discussion highlights challenges in executing the strategy, potential back-testing bias, and the importance of considering taxes.

Emotional recovery is also emphasized, with encouragement to avoid dwelling on the past and to focus on steady progress.
