**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 353 | **Comments:** 96 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The Reddit post compares a Buy-&-Hold strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings when economic anxiety peaks (measured by Google trends for 'recession').

The discussion highlights concerns about the back-testing methodology, the feasibility of implementing the Fear-Based strategy in real-time, and the impact of taxes on the strategy's performance. There is a consensus that while the Fear-Based strategy shows some benefits, it may not be practical or superior to a simple Buy-&-Hold approach for most investors.
