## 28. [Should you have FIRE’d sooner?](https://reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1puew0m/should_you_have_fired_sooner/)

**Summary:** The post discusses the trade-offs between following the conservative 4% withdrawal rule for retirement and opting for a higher withdrawal rate (e.g., 7%) to retire earlier. The debate centers on balancing financial security with the desire to enjoy retirement sooner. Key points include: The 4% rule is conservative but provides long-term security. Higher withdrawal rates (e.g., 7%) increase the risk of portfolio depletion due to sequence of returns risk. Many retirees value the peace of mind from a larger financial cushion. Some regret not retiring earlier but acknowledge the risks of higher withdrawal rates. The decision depends on personal risk tolerance and financial goals. The discussion highlights a consensus that while higher withdrawal rates could allow for earlier retirement, they come with significant risks, particularly from poor market performance early in retirement. Most commenters advocate for a balanced approach, prioritizing long-term security over immediate gratification.
