**Key Points:**
- The 4% rule is conservative and historically reliable but may lead to leaving a large financial cushion unused.
- Higher withdrawal rates (e.g., 7%) increase the risk of portfolio failure, especially during bad market sequences.
- Some retirees regret not retiring earlier, while others value the security of a larger financial cushion.
- Sequence of returns risk is a major concern, particularly in the first 10-15 years of retirement.
- Personal circumstances and risk tolerance play a significant role in retirement decisions.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights a consensus that while higher withdrawal rates can enable earlier retirement, they come with significant risks, particularly from sequence of returns. Many commenters emphasize the importance of balancing financial security with the desire to retire early, noting that individual circumstances and risk tolerance are key factors in the decision.
