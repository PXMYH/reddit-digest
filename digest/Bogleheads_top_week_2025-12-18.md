## 1. [Vanguard Final Estimated Year-End 2025 Distributions](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pod994/vanguard_final_estimated_yearend_2025/)

**Author:** u/EevelBob | **Upvotes:** 186 | **Comments:** 20 | **Date:** 2025-12-16

**Summary:** The Reddit post discusses Vanguard's final estimated year-end 2025 distributions, explaining that a mutual fund's NAV decreases by the exact amount of the dividend or distribution paid out on the ex-dividend date. This is because the fund returns cash or shares to investors, reducing the fund's total assets.

**Key Points:**

- Dividends are not 'free money' as they reduce the fund's total assets.
- Dividends can lead to compounding and help redistribute gains in an index fund.
- The post highlights common misconceptions about dividends and their impact on fund performance.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights common misconceptions about dividends, with top comments pointing out that dividends are not 'free money' and that the NAV decrease is a result of the fund returning cash or shares to investors. There is also a question about the impact of dividends on compounding and gains redistribution in index funds.

## 3. [VT and Chill?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pmrbbp/vt_and_chill/)

**Author:** u/tryingmybesttolearn2 | **Upvotes:** 134 | **Comments:** 71 | **Date:** 2025-12-14

**Summary:** The Reddit post discusses the suitability of VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) as a comprehensive investment option. The author, a 33-year-old with a TSP invested in the S&P 500, seeks advice on whether to include additional ETFs alongside VT. The comments overwhelmingly support VT as a standalone, all-in-one solution for global equity exposure. Key points include: VT is praised as a one-stop shop for total domestic and international index investing; the consensus is to avoid adding more equity-tracking ETFs if using VT; VT and chill is considered a simple and effective investment strategy; the author's existing S&P 500 investment in TSP may lead to an overweight in US stocks if VT is added; and an alternative approach is to use VTI (US) and VXUS (international) to approximate VT's allocation. The discussion highlights a strong consensus around the simplicity and effectiveness of VT as a standalone investment, with many commenters emphasizing the 'VT and chill' strategy.
