## 1. [Vanguard Final Estimated Year-End 2025 Distributions](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pod994/vanguard_final_estimated_yearend_2025/)

**Author:** u/EevelBob | **Upvotes:** 187 | **Comments:** 20 | **Date:** 2025-12-16

**Summary:** The post discusses Vanguard's final estimated year-end 2025 distributions, explaining that mutual fund NAV decreases by the exact amount of dividends or distributions paid out on the ex-dividend date. This is because the fund returns cash or shares to investors, reducing the fund's total assets.

**Key Points:**
- Mutual fund NAV decreases by the exact amount of dividends or distributions paid out.
- Dividends are not 'free money' as they reduce the fund's total assets.
- Dividends can lead to compounding and help redistribute gains in an index fund.
- Investors often misunderstand why fund values decrease after distributions.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights common misconceptions about dividends, with some users pointing out that dividends are not free money and others questioning the impact of dividends on compounding and gains redistribution. The consensus seems to be that dividends reduce the fund's NAV but can contribute to long-term growth through compounding.
