## 1. [Vanguard Final Estimated Year-End 2025 Distributions](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pod994/vanguard_final_estimated_yearend_2025/)

**Author:** u/EevelBob | **Upvotes:** 182 | **Comments:** 20 | **Date:** 2025-12-16

**Summary:** The post discusses Vanguard's final estimated year-end 2025 distributions, explaining that mutual fund NAV decreases by the exact amount of the dividend or distribution paid out on the ex-dividend date. This is because the fund returns cash or shares to investors, reducing the fund's total assets.

**Key Points:**
- Mutual fund NAV decreases by the exact amount of the dividend or distribution paid out.
- Dividends are not 'free money' as they reduce the fund's total assets.
- Dividends can lead to compounding and help redistribute gains in an index fund.
- Investors often misunderstand why fund value decreases after a dividend payout.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights common misconceptions about dividends, with some users pointing out that dividends are not free money and others questioning the impact of dividends on compounding and gains redistribution. The consensus seems to be that dividends reduce the fund's NAV but can contribute to long-term growth through compounding.

## 3. [VT and Chill?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pmrbbp/vt_and_chill/)

**Author:** u/tryingmybesttolearn2 | **Upvotes:** 133 | **Comments:** 71 | **Date:** 2025-12-14

**Summary:** The post discusses a 33-year-old's interest in using VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) for their portfolio outside of their TSP, which is fully invested in the S&P 500.

**Key Points:**
- VT is recommended as a one-stop shop for total domestic and international index exposure.

- The user's TSP allocation to the S&P 500 may lead to an overweight in US stocks if VT is used.
- Alternatives like VTI and VXUS are suggested to approximate VT's global exposure while balancing US market weight.
- The consensus leans towards 'VT and chill' as a simple and effective strategy.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights a strong consensus around VT as a comprehensive and simple solution for global diversification. However, some commenters caution about potential US market overweight due to the user's TSP allocation and suggest alternatives like VTI and VXUS to achieve a more balanced portfolio.
