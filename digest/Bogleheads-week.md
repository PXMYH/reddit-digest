## 1. [Why do I need bonds when I already keep a significant amount in my HYSA? I'm 30 years old](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qk02gk/why_do_i_need_bonds_when_i_already_keep_a/)

**Author:** u/SurvivorFanatic236 | **Upvotes:** 188 | **Comments:** 103 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** The post questions the necessity of bonds in a portfolio when a significant amount is already held in a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA). The author, a 30-year-old, keeps one year of expenses in a HYSA and is skeptical about the benefits of bonds given their recent performance.

**Key Points:**
- The author keeps one year of expenses ($45,000) in a HYSA, which is about 15% of their net worth.
- The author's 401k is in a target date fund with 8% bonds, and they have $2,000 in BND, which has shown poor performance.
- Top comments highlight the importance of dividend yields and the stability of bonds compared to HYSA returns.
- Bonds are seen as volatility dampeners and are recommended for short-term value preservation.
- At 30 years old, the author may not need bonds beyond their HYSA, but bonds can be beneficial for long-term stability.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion emphasizes the role of bonds in providing stability and preserving value, especially in volatile markets. While the author may not need bonds at their current age, bonds are seen as a hedge against market downturns and can offer better long-term returns compared to HYSAs. The consensus is that bonds, despite their recent performance, play a crucial role in a diversified portfolio.

## 2. [Valuations are poor market timing indicators.](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qjyw25/valuations_are_poor_market_timing_indicators/)

**Author:** u/sneakysocks544 | **Upvotes:** 149 | **Comments:** 35 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Key Points:**
- Valuations are poor indicators for market timing.
- Investors should adhere to their asset allocation based on risk tolerance.
- Short-term valuations (e.g., trailing 12mo PE) have weak correlation with performance.

- High valuations may indicate lower future returns but should not dictate investment decisions.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion consensus leans towards the idea that while valuations may provide some insight, they should not be the primary factor in making investment decisions. Most commenters agree that broad market indexing and sticking to a long-term strategy is the correct approach, regardless of current valuations.
