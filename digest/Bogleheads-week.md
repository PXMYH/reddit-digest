**Author:** u/rjbergen | **Upvotes:** 128 | **Comments:** 145 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** A couple in their mid-30s consulted a fee-only CFP for retirement planning but found the investment recommendations overly conservative for their 20+ year horizon. The CFP suggested a high allocation to bonds and money market funds, which the couple and commenters deemed inappropriate for their age and risk tolerance.

**Key Points:**
- Couple (35M and 35F) with a 20+ year investment horizon and moderate risk tolerance.
- CFP's recommendations were seen as overly conservative, with 28% in bonds/T-bills and 10% in money market funds.
- The couple prefers a simpler, more aggressive portfolio like VT or VTI/VXUS.
- Commenters criticized the CFP's recommendations as a 'Humpty Dumpty Portfolio' and 'cookie cutter'.
- Suggestions to ask for an R-squared analysis to check for fund overlap.

**Discussion Highlights:** The consensus among commenters was that the CFP's recommendations were overly conservative and not tailored to the couple's age and risk tolerance. Many suggested the portfolio was a generic, one-size-fits-all approach rather than a personalized plan.

## 2. [Why do I need bonds when I already keep a significant amount in my HYSA? I'm 30 years old](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qk02gk/why_do_i_need_bonds_when_i_already_keep_a/)

**Author:** u/SurvivorFanatic236 | **Upvotes:** 207 | **Comments:** 113 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** The post questions the necessity of bonds when the user already has a significant amount in a HYSA. The discussion highlights the role of bonds as volatility dampeners and their historical performance compared to HYSA.

- Bonds provide stability and reduce volatility in a portfolio.
- Historical performance of bonds (e.g., BND) shows fluctuations but includes dividend yields.
- HYSA returns can vary significantly over time and may not always be favorable.
- At 30 years old, the user may not need additional bonds beyond their HYSA.
- The focus should be on total return, not just price changes, when evaluating bond funds.

**Discussion Highlights:** The consensus among commenters is that while bonds may not be necessary at the user's age, they serve as a hedge against market volatility. The importance of considering total return, including dividends, is emphasized, and the historical variability of HYSA returns is noted.
