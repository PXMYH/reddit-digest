## 7. [Why do I need bonds when I already keep a significant amount in my HYSA? I'm 30 years old](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qk02gk/why_do_i_need_bonds_when_i_already_keep_a/)

**Author:** u/SurvivorFanatic236 | **Upvotes:** 201 | **Comments:** 113 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** The post questions the necessity of bonds when the user already has a significant amount in a HYSA. The discussion highlights the role of bonds as volatility dampeners and their historical performance compared to HYSA.

At 30 years old, the user may not need bonds on top of their HYSA. The consensus from the comments suggests that while bonds may not be necessary at the user's age, they serve as a hedge against market volatility and provide stable returns through dividend yields. The discussion also points out that HYSA returns can be variable and historically lower than bonds.
