- Alternatives like a VT portfolio or VTI/VXUS combination are preferred by the couple and commenters.
- Specific critiques include high bond/T-bill allocations and unnecessary money market recommendations.

## 2. [Why do I need bonds when I already keep a significant amount in my HYSA? I'm 30 years old](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qk02gk/why_do_i_need_bonds_when_i_already_keep_a/)

**Author:** u/SurvivorFanatic236 | **Upvotes:** 192 | **Comments:** 103 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** The post questions the necessity of bonds when the author already has a significant amount in a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA). The discussion highlights the role of bonds in providing stability and dividends, contrasting with the variable interest rates of HYSA.

**Key Points:**
- The author keeps one year of expenses ($45,000) in a HYSA, which is about 15% of their net worth.
- Bonds provide dividend yields and stability, which are not captured by looking at price alone.
- Historically, HYSA returns have been low, and bonds can offer more predictable returns when held to maturity.
- At 30 years old, the author may not need bonds beyond their HYSA, but bonds can serve as volatility dampeners.
- The focus should be on total return, not just the price of bond funds.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion emphasizes the importance of considering dividend yields and total return when evaluating bonds. It also notes that while the author may not need bonds at their current age, bonds can provide stability and preserve value in the short term. The consensus suggests that bonds can be a useful hedge against market volatility, even if HYSA provides some liquidity.

**Summary:** The post discusses the limited usefulness of stock valuations as market timing indicators, advising investors to stick to their asset allocation. Comments debate the relevance of valuations over different time horizons and their correlation with returns.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights a consensus that while valuations may not be useful for short-term decisions, they could have some relevance for long-term performance. Most agree that sticking to a predetermined investment strategy is optimal.

## 13. [VTI + VXUS hold 12,158 number of stocks. VT holds 9,950 number of stocks. So which ETF would truly be total world.](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qfs4ej/vti_vxus_hold_12158_number_of_stocks_vt_holds/)

**Author:** u/marzthemagnificent | **Upvotes:** 179 | **Comments:** 52 | **Date:** 2026-01-17

The discussion highlights the trade-offs between the broader coverage of VTI + VXUS and the simplicity and ease of VT. Key points include: VTI + VXUS combined hold 12,158 stocks, while VT holds 9,950 stocks; the extra 2,208 stocks in VTI + VXUS are likely global microcaps with minimal impact on returns; VT is preferred by many for its simplicity and lower maintenance, despite holding fewer stocks; proper weighting is crucial when holding VTI + VXUS to achieve true global market representation; and cost and rebalancing efforts are considerations when choosing between VT and VTI + VXUS. The consensus leans toward VT for its simplicity and ease of management, even though VTI + VXUS technically cover more stocks. The additional stocks are mostly microcaps with negligible impact on overall returns, and the hassle of rebalancing two funds often outweighs the benefits of the extra coverage.

## 15. [100% VT For 500k?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qfgzus/100_vt_for_500k/)

**Author:** u/SensiiNips_ | **Upvotes:** 153 | **Comments:** 147 | **Date:** 2026-01-17

**Summary:** The post discusses the idea of investing 100% in VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) for a $500k portfolio, with the author considering a 5% annual withdrawal for travel. The discussion revolves around the simplicity of this approach versus potential diversification or inclusion of bonds.
