## 7. [Why do I need bonds when I already keep a significant amount in my HYSA? I'm 30 years old](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qk02gk/why_do_i_need_bonds_when_i_already_keep_a/)

**Author:** u/SurvivorFanatic236 | **Upvotes:** 208 | **Comments:** 113 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** The post questions the necessity of bonds in a portfolio when a significant amount is already held in a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA). The author highlights the underperformance of their bond investment (BND) and seeks clarification on the role of bonds. Key points include: the author keeps one year of expenses ($45,000) in a HYSA, their 401k has 8% bonds, and they have an additional $2,000 in BND. Bonds provide dividend yields and have a set interest rate over time, unlike cash which is subject to interest rate changes. Historically, HYSA returns have been low, and bonds held to maturity can preserve value in the short term. At 30 years old, the author may not need bonds beyond their HYSA, but bonds can serve as volatility dampeners. The discussion highlights the importance of considering dividend yields and the stability of bonds compared to cash. While the author may not need additional bonds at their age, bonds can provide stability and preserve value during market downturns. The consensus suggests that bonds are not strictly necessary at 30, but they can be beneficial for reducing volatility.
