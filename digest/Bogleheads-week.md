## 13. [Why is ETF the only term I seem to hear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qgg654/why_is_etf_the_only_term_i_seem_to_hear/)

**Author:** u/spookymonsterscary | **Upvotes:** 117 | **Comments:** 107 | **Date:** 2026-01-18

**Summary:** The Reddit post discusses the author's confusion about the prevalence of ETF discussions over mutual funds, despite their similarities. The comments highlight key differences such as trading flexibility and behavioral advantages.
