## 13. [How do you contribute exactly the 401K limit?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qc0nzt/how_do_you_contribute_exactly_the_401k_limit/)

**Author:** u/fungus_among_us_art | **Upvotes:** 221 | **Comments:** 98 | **Date:** 2026-01-13

**Summary:** The post discusses strategies for contributing exactly the 401K limit of $24,500, considering employer matching and variable bonuses. The author shares their solution after receiving advice from the community. Key points include: Employer contributions do not count toward the $24,500 limit; employers may offer 'true up' to cover missed matching contributions if you overshoot the limit; without 'true up,' periodic adjustments are needed to hit the contribution amount accurately; some 401K plans offer an 'After Tax' option for additional retirement savings; and payroll systems typically cap contributions at the federal limit. The discussion highlights that employer contributions are separate from the federal limit and suggests strategies like overshooting the limit if 'true up' is available or making periodic adjustments if not.

While some explore alternatives to mitigate inflation, the majority emphasize the importance of having readily accessible cash for emergencies.
