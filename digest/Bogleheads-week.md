## 9. [Why do I need bonds when I already keep a significant amount in my HYSA? I'm 30 years old](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qk02gk/why_do_i_need_bonds_when_i_already_keep_a/)

**Author:** u/SurvivorFanatic236 | **Upvotes:** 211 | **Comments:** 116 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** The post questions the necessity of bonds when the author already maintains a significant emergency fund in a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA). The discussion highlights the role of bonds in providing stability and dividend yields, contrasting with the variable returns of HYSA. Key points include: Bonds provide dividend yields, offer a fixed interest rate over time, and can preserve value in the short term. At 30 years old, the author may not need additional bonds beyond their HYSA, but bonds can act as volatility dampeners. The focus should be on total return from bonds, including interest, rather than just price changes. The consensus from the comments suggests that while the author may not need additional bonds at their age, bonds serve as a hedge against market volatility and provide steady returns through dividends.
