## 1. [Why do I need bonds when I already keep a significant amount in my HYSA? I'm 30 years old](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qk02gk/why_do_i_need_bonds_when_i_already_keep_a/)

**Author:** u/SurvivorFanatic236 | **Upvotes:** 177 | **Comments:** 98 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** The post questions the necessity of bonds when the author already has a significant amount in a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA). The discussion highlights the role of bonds in providing stability and dividends, contrasting with the variable interest rates of HYSA.

**Key Points:**

- Bonds have a set interest rate over a period, unlike HYSA which is subject to interest rate changes.
- Historically, HYSA returns have been low, and bonds can preserve value in the short term.
- At 30 years old, the author may not need bonds on top of their HYSA.
- The focus should be on total return, not just the price of bond funds.

**Discussion Highlights:** The consensus among commenters is that while bonds may not be necessary at the author's age, they offer stability and dividends that HYSA cannot guarantee. The discussion emphasizes the importance of considering total return and the historical performance of HYSA.
