## 4. [Why do I need bonds when I already keep a significant amount in my HYSA? I'm 30 years old](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qk02gk/why_do_i_need_bonds_when_i_already_keep_a/)

**Author:** u/SurvivorFanatic236 | **Upvotes:** 201 | **Comments:** 111 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** The post questions the necessity of bonds when the author already has a significant amount in a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA). The discussion highlights the role of bonds in providing stability and dividend yields, contrasting with the variable interest rates of HYSA.

- At 30 years old, the author may not need bonds beyond their HYSA, but bonds can act as volatility dampeners.
- The focus should be on total return from bonds, not just price fluctuations.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion emphasizes the importance of bonds for stability and dividend yields, noting that while HYSA interest rates can fluctuate, bonds held to maturity can preserve value.

## 5. [Valuations are poor market timing indicators.](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qjyw25/valuations_are_poor_market_timing_indicators/)

**Author:** u/sneakysocks544 | **Upvotes:** 154 | **Comments:** 37 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Key Points:**
- Valuations are poor indicators for market timing.
- A buy-and-hold strategy aligned with risk tolerance is recommended.
- Short-term valuations (e.g., trailing 12mo PE) are less predictive than long-term metrics like Shiller PE.

- Long-term investors should focus less on valuations than those closer to retirement.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion reveals a consensus that while valuations may have some predictive power over longer time horizons (e.g., 10 years), they are not reliable for short-term market timing. Most commenters agree that investors should stick to their asset allocation regardless of valuation levels, though some acknowledge the potential utility of metrics like the Shiller PE for long-term planning.
