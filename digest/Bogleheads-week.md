## 5. [Why do I need bonds when I already keep a significant amount in my HYSA? I'm 30 years old](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qk02gk/why_do_i_need_bonds_when_i_already_keep_a/)

- Bonds, such as BND, have shown minimal gains and even losses over certain periods, leading to questions about their utility.

- At the age of 30, the author may not need bonds beyond their HYSA, but bonds can serve as volatility dampeners and preserve value in the short term.
