## 1. [Why do I need bonds when I already keep a significant amount in my HYSA? I'm 30 years old](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qk02gk/why_do_i_need_bonds_when_i_already_keep_a/)

**Author:** u/SurvivorFanatic236 | **Upvotes:** 153 | **Comments:** 85 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** The post questions the necessity of bonds in a portfolio when a significant amount is already held in a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA). The discussion highlights the role of bonds in providing stability and dividends, contrasting with the variable returns of HYSA.

**Key Points:**
- The author keeps one year of expenses ($45,000) in a HYSA, which is about 15% of their net worth.
- The author's 401k has 8% bonds, and they have an additional $2,000 in BND, which has shown minimal gains.
- Top comments emphasize the importance of bond dividends and the historical variability of HYSA returns.
- Bonds provide a set interest rate over time, unlike HYSA which is subject to interest rate changes.
- At 30 years old, the author may not need additional bonds beyond their HYSA, but bonds can serve as volatility dampeners.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion consensus suggests that while bonds may not be necessary at the author's age, they offer stability and dividends. HYSA returns can be variable, and bonds provide a fixed interest rate, making them a useful hedge against market volatility.

**Summary:** The post discusses how stock valuations are not reliable indicators for market timing and advises investors to stick to their asset allocation based on risk tolerance. The discussion highlights varying perspectives on the relevance of valuations for different investment horizons.

- High valuations may indicate lower future returns, but market timing based on valuations is not recommended.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion consensus supports the idea that while high valuations may correlate with lower future returns, attempting to time the market based on valuations is not advisable. Most commenters agree that sticking to a long-term investment strategy and maintaining asset allocation is the best approach, regardless of current valuations.
