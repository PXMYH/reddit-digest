## 8. [VTI + VXUS hold 12,158 number of stocks. VT holds 9,950 number of stocks. So which ETF would truly be total world.](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qfs4ej/vti_vxus_hold_12158_number_of_stocks_vt_holds/)

**Summary:** The post discusses whether holding both VTI and VXUS (totaling 12,158 stocks) is more comprehensive than holding VT alone (9,950 stocks). The discussion highlights the trade-offs between the additional coverage of microcaps and the simplicity of managing a single fund like VT. Key points include: VTI + VXUS combined hold more stocks (12,158) than VT alone (9,950); the extra stocks in VTI + VXUS are likely global microcaps with minimal impact on returns; VT offers simplicity and ease of management as a single fund; there are costs associated with holding and managing more funds, which may not be justified by the additional coverage; and proper weighting is crucial if opting for VTI + VXUS to achieve true global representation. The consensus leans towards VT for its simplicity and ease of management, despite holding fewer stocks. The additional stocks in VTI + VXUS are seen as having minimal impact on overall returns, and the hassle of rebalancing two funds is considered a drawback. However, if properly weighted, VTI + VXUS can provide a more comprehensive global coverage.
