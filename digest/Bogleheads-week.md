## 2. [Boglehead perspective on buying vs renting. What am I missing?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qhiyj2/boglehead_perspective_on_buying_vs_renting_what/)

**Author:** u/No-Definition2856 | **Upvotes:** 176 | **Comments:** 219 | **Date:** 2026-01-19

**Summary:** The post questions why buying a house is discouraged as a way to preserve money, even if some capital is recovered upon sale, compared to renting where all payments are lost. The discussion explores the nuances of homeownership costs, investment potential, and personal preferences. Key points include: buying a house is not considered a good investment due to low returns, high costs, and opportunity costs compared to index funds; the author struggles with the idea that buying allows partial capital recovery, unlike renting where all payments are lost; top comments highlight that homeownership is not purely an investment and depends on individual circumstances, costs, and market conditions; Ben Felix's analysis is recommended for a deeper understanding of the financial implications of buying vs. renting; and realistic assessment of homeownership costs (e.g., property taxes, maintenance) is crucial for accurate comparison. The consensus is that while buying a house may not be a great investment, it is not inherently bad if mortgage and maintenance costs are lower than rent. Personal preferences, local market conditions, and realistic cost assessments play significant roles in the decision.
