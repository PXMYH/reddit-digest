## 1. [How do you contribute exactly the 401K limit?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qc0nzt/how_do_you_contribute_exactly_the_401k_limit/)

**Author:** u/fungus_among_us_art | **Upvotes:** 155 | **Comments:** 82 | **Date:** 2026-01-13

**Summary:** The post discusses strategies for contributing exactly the 401K limit of $24,500, considering employer matching and variable bonuses. The author seeks advice on how to avoid missing out on matching contributions due to overshooting the limit. Key points include: Employer contributions do not count toward the $24,500 limit; employers may offer 'true up' to cover missed matching contributions if the limit is overshot; without 'true up,' periodic adjustments to contribution percentages are necessary; payroll systems typically cap contributions at the federal limit; and calculating contributions based on pay periods can help in getting close to the limit. The discussion highlights that employer contributions are separate from the federal limit and suggests strategies like overshooting the limit if 'true up' is available or making periodic adjustments to contribution percentages. There is a consensus that payroll systems usually cap contributions at the federal limit, and calculating based on pay periods can help in getting close to the desired contribution amount.
