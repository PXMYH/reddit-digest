**Author:** u/EevelBob | **Upvotes:** 185 | **Comments:** 20 | **Date:** 2025-12-16

**Summary:** The post discusses Vanguard's final estimated year-end 2025 distributions, explaining that mutual fund NAV decreases by the exact amount of the dividend or distribution paid out on the ex-dividend date.

- Dividends are not 'free money' but rather a return of the fund's assets to investors.
- The ex-dividend date is when the NAV adjustment occurs.
- Some investors may not understand why the NAV decreases when the market goes up.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights common misconceptions about dividends, with some investors mistakenly believing dividends are free money. There is also a question about whether dividends lead to compounding and increased gains in index funds.
