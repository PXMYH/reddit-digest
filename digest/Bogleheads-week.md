## 2. [Why do I need bonds when I already keep a significant amount in my HYSA? I'm 30 years old](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qk02gk/why_do_i_need_bonds_when_i_already_keep_a/)

**Author:** u/SurvivorFanatic236 | **Upvotes:** 195 | **Comments:** 105 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** The post questions the necessity of bonds when the author already has a significant amount in a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA). The discussion highlights the role of bonds in providing stability and dividends, contrasting with the variable returns of HYSA.

**Key Points:**
- Bonds provide stability and dividends, which are often overlooked when focusing solely on price performance.
- HYSA returns can be variable and historically have had periods of low returns.
- At 30 years old, the author may not need bonds beyond their HYSA, but bonds can serve as volatility dampeners.
- The focus should be on total return, including interest, rather than just the price of bond funds.

**Discussion Highlights:** The consensus suggests that while bonds may not be necessary at the author's age, they offer benefits like stability and dividends. The discussion emphasizes the importance of considering total return and historical performance when evaluating bonds versus HYSA.
