## 4. [Why do I need bonds when I already keep a significant amount in my HYSA? I'm 30 years old](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qk02gk/why_do_i_need_bonds_when_i_already_keep_a/)

**Author:** u/SurvivorFanatic236 | **Upvotes:** 198 | **Comments:** 105 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** The post questions the necessity of bonds in a portfolio when a significant amount is already held in a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA). The discussion highlights the role of bonds in providing stability, preserving value, and generating returns through dividends, even if their price performance is lackluster. Key points include: Bonds provide stability and preserve value in the short term, acting as volatility dampeners. Historical performance of HYSA shows variable returns, often lower than bonds in the long term. Dividends from bonds contribute significantly to their total return, even if the bond price itself does not appreciate. At 30 years old, the need for bonds may be minimal, but they become more relevant as one approaches retirement. BND (a bond fund) has shown poor price performance but should be evaluated based on total return, including dividends. The consensus emphasizes that while HYSAs are useful for liquidity and short-term safety, bonds play a critical role in long-term portfolio stability and income generation. Bonds are particularly valued for their ability to dampen volatility and preserve capital during market downturns, making them a key component of a diversified investment strategy.

## 11. [Boglehead perspective on buying vs renting. What am I missing?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qhiyj2/boglehead_perspective_on_buying_vs_renting_what/)

**Author:** u/No-Definition2856 | **Upvotes:** 184 | **Comments:** 232 | **Date:** 2026-01-19

**Summary:** The post questions why buying a house is discouraged as a way to preserve money, even when some capital is recovered upon sale, compared to renting where all payments are lost. The discussion explores the nuances of homeownership costs, investment comparisons, and personal preferences.

Realistic assessment of homeownership costs, including property taxes, maintenance, and transaction fees, is crucial.

Personal circumstances and realistic cost assessments are key factors in the decision-making process.
