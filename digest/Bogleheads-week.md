## 1. [Why do I need bonds when I already keep a significant amount in my HYSA? I'm 30 years old](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qk02gk/why_do_i_need_bonds_when_i_already_keep_a/)

**Author:** u/SurvivorFanatic236 | **Upvotes:** 130 | **Comments:** 81 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** The post questions the necessity of bonds when the user already has a significant amount in a HYSA. The discussion highlights the role of bonds as volatility dampeners and the importance of considering total return, including dividends. Key points include: Bonds act as volatility dampeners and preserve value in the short term; The performance of bonds should be evaluated based on total return, including dividends; Historically, HYSA returns have been variable and sometimes low; At 30 years old, the user may not need bonds beyond their HYSA; Bonds have a set interest rate over a period, unlike cash which is subject to interest rate changes. The consensus from the comments suggests that while bonds may not be necessary at the user's age, they serve as a hedge against market volatility and provide stable returns through dividends. The discussion also emphasizes the importance of looking at total return rather than just price performance.
