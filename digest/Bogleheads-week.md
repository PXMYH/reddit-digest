## 1. [Why do I need bonds when I already keep a significant amount in my HYSA? I'm 30 years old](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1qk02gk/why_do_i_need_bonds_when_i_already_keep_a/)

**Author:** u/SurvivorFanatic236 | **Upvotes:** 166 | **Comments:** 92 | **Date:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** The post questions the necessity of bonds in a portfolio when a significant amount is already held in a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA). The author, a 30-year-old, keeps one year of expenses in a HYSA and wonders if this is sufficient as a hedge against market downturns.

**Key Points:**
- The author keeps one year of expenses ($45,000) in a HYSA, which is about 15% of their net worth.
- The author's 401k is in a target date fund with 8% bonds, and they have $2,000 in BND, which has shown poor performance.
- Top comments highlight the importance of dividend yields from bonds, the stability of bonds compared to cash, and the historical performance of HYSAs.
- Some commenters suggest that at 30, bonds may not be necessary on top of a HYSA, but bonds can serve as volatility dampeners.
- The consensus is that bonds provide stability and preserve value in the short term, but the author may not need additional bonds at their age.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion emphasizes the role of bonds in providing stability and preserving value, especially in volatile markets. While the author's HYSA provides a hedge, bonds offer additional benefits such as dividend yields and long-term stability. The consensus is that at 30, the author may not need additional bonds beyond their HYSA, but bonds can still play a role in a diversified portfolio.
