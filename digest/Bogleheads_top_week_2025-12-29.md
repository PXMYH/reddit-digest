## 8. [Selling Everything Based on Fear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pvmu78/selling_everything_based_on_fear/)

**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 365 | **Comments:** 100 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The Reddit post compares a Buy-&-Hold investment strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings when economic anxiety peaks (measured by Google Trends for 'recession'). The analysis shows that while the Fear-Based strategy outperforms slightly in a tax-free scenario, the difference is minimal, and the Buy-&-Hold strategy is more beneficial when considering taxes and long-term investing.

**Key Points:**
- The Fear-Based strategy slightly outperforms Buy-&-Hold in a tax-free scenario but underperforms when taxes are considered.
- The Buy-&-Hold strategy results in a total return of $1,366,099.44 with a CAGR of 24.62%, while the Fear-Based strategy yields $1,526,205.95 with a CAGR of 25.25% in a tax-free scenario.
- After accounting for a 15% capital gains tax, the Fear-Based strategy's total return drops to $1,224,092.62, making it less favorable than Buy-&-Hold.
- The Fear-Based strategy significantly reduces the maximum drawdown from -42.69% to -18.90% in a tax-free scenario.
- The author concludes that staying invested and continuing to invest regularly is the best strategy for long-term investors.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights several key points: the Fear-Based strategy may be overfitted to recent decades and lacks robustness for future market conditions; implementing such a strategy requires strong emotional discipline during market turbulence; the analysis assumes optimal timing for both selling and buying back in, which is difficult to achieve in practice; and the importance of considering taxes and transaction costs in real-world scenarios.
