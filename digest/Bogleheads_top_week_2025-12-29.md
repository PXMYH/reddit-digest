## 7. [Selling Everything Based on Fear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pvmu78/selling_everything_based_on_fear/)

**Author:** u/Alphanaught | **Upvotes:** 358 | **Comments:** 100 | **Date:** 2025-12-25

**Summary:** The Reddit post compares a Buy-&-Hold investment strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings when economic anxiety peaks (measured by Google Trends for 'recession'). The analysis shows that while the Fear-Based strategy performs slightly better in a tax-free scenario, the difference is minimal, and the Buy-&-Hold strategy is more advantageous when considering capital gains taxes. Key points include the Fear-Based strategy outperforming Buy-&-Hold in a tax-free scenario but underperforming when taxes are considered, reducing maximum drawdown significantly, and involving selling SPY and moving into short-term treasuries when economic anxiety is high. The discussion highlights concerns about the Fear-Based strategy being back-tested on data from the same period it was developed, the difficulty of executing such a strategy in real-time under turbulent conditions, and the importance of considering taxes and timing in investment decisions.
