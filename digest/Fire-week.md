**Summary:** A couple in their 50s with a high net worth and no other debts is considering paying off their $340k mortgage at a 2.875% interest rate, despite initial hesitation due to the low rate. They express excitement at the prospect of being completely debt-free.

**Key Points:**
- Couple has upper 7-figure net worth and no other debts
- Mortgage has a 2.875% interest rate, making aggressive payoff less mathematically compelling
- Financial planner recommends paying off mortgage due to their tax bracket
- Emotional benefit of being debt-free is a significant factor
- Reddit comments show divided opinions on the financial wisdom of this decision

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights a divide between those who view the decision purely through a mathematical lens (arguing the low interest rate makes it unwise to pay off) and those who emphasize the emotional and psychological benefits of being debt-free. Some commenters congratulate the couple while questioning the financial logic, while others support the decision based on personal freedom and peace of mind.
