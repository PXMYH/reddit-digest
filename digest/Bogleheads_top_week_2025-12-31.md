## 11. [Selling Everything Based on Fear](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pvmu78/selling_everything_based_on_fear/)

The author concludes that staying invested is best for long-term investors.

- After accounting for 15% capital gains tax, Fear-Based underperformed (Total Return: $1,224,092.62 vs. $1,366,099.44).
- Fear-Based strategy had lower max drawdown (-18.90% vs. -42.69%) and higher Sharpe ratio (0.96 vs. 0.63) in a tax-free scenario.
- The strategy was back-tested using data from the same period it was developed, which may introduce bias.
- Timing the market is challenging, and the Fear-Based strategy assumes perfect execution, which may not be feasible in real-world conditions.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights concerns about back-testing bias, the practicality of executing the Fear-Based strategy in real-time, and the impact of taxes on returns. The consensus leans towards the Buy-&-Hold strategy for long-term investors due to its simplicity and lower risk of timing errors.
