## 30. [Using taxable brokerage account as bridge between FIRE age and 59.5 by leveraging 0% LTCG tax rate](https://reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1pzs4hx/using_taxable_brokerage_account_as_bridge_between/)

**Author:** u/Bismo789 | **Upvotes:** 125 | **Comments:** 76 | **Date:** 2025-12-30

**Summary:** The post discusses using a taxable brokerage account as a bridge between early retirement and age 59.5 by leveraging the 0% long-term capital gains tax rate. The strategy involves liquidating assets tax-free within the annual LTCG limit to cover living expenses until retirement accounts can be accessed penalty-free.

**Key Points:**
- The 0% LTCG tax rate can be leveraged to withdraw funds tax-free up to a certain limit (e.g., $96,700 for married filing jointly).
- The strategy is feasible and commonly used in early retirement planning, known as 'tax gain harvesting'.
- A substantial cost basis is required to maximize the benefits of this strategy.
- Alternative strategies like IRS rule 72T/SEPP can be used to access retirement accounts early, though subject to ordinary income tax.
- The standard deduction and HSA contributions can further extend the tax-free withdrawal limit.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion generally supports the strategy as legitimate and effective for bridging the gap between early retirement and traditional retirement age. Key considerations include the need for a substantial cost basis, the potential use of rule 72T/SEPP for early access to retirement accounts, and the impact of standard deductions and HSA contributions on tax-free withdrawal limits.
