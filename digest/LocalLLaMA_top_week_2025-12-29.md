**Author:** u/vox-deorum | **Upvotes:** 624 | **Comments:** 151 | **Date:** 2025-12-24

**Summary:** Researchers used open-source LLMs (GPT-OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) to play 1,408 full games of Civilization V, finding that LLMs can survive full games and develop distinct playstyles. The LLMs performed slightly better in best scores but worse in win rates compared to baseline AI. Key points include: LLMs can survive full Civilization V games with a hybrid approach, achieving ~97.5% survival rate; OSS-120B favored a warmonger playstyle with more Domination victories, while GLM-4.6 played more balanced; Both models preferred the Order ideology (~24% more likely) over Freedom; Cost per game was ~$0.86 for OSS-120B, with input tokens scaling linearly as the game progresses; The study suggests that even smaller models (e.g., OSS-20B) can perform adequately. The community expressed excitement about the potential for LLMs to enhance gameplay, with interest in integrating them into multiplayer games. Some users speculated about future applications beyond gaming, while others inquired about the performance of smaller models.
