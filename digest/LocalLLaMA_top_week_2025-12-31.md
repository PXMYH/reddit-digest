## 30. [All of the major open weight labs have shifted to large params general models instead of smaller, more focused models. By this time next year, there won’t be much “local” about this sub unless the paradigm shifts to smaller models good at specific domains.](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pv2cnz/all_of_the_major_open_weight_labs_have_shifted_to/)

**Author:** u/LocoMod | **Upvotes:** 233 | **Comments:** 243 | **Date:** 2025-12-24

**Summary:** The post discusses the shift in open weight labs towards larger, general models, making it difficult for local users to run them without significant hardware. It calls for a return to smaller, domain-specific models that can be run locally with limited resources.

**Key Points:**
- Open weight labs are increasingly focusing on large, general models that require substantial hardware resources.
- Local users are struggling to run these models due to hardware limitations and cost constraints.
- There is a call for a return to smaller, domain-specific models that can be run locally with limited resources.
- Recent releases like Mistral's 14B models and Qwen3's smaller models are noted as exceptions.
- The discussion highlights the tension between open weights and local accessibility.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights a consensus that while larger models are becoming the norm, there is still a demand for smaller, more focused models that can be run locally. Some users point out recent releases of smaller models as positive developments, while others express frustration at the reliance on large corporations for model development.

## 32. [We asked OSS-120B and GLM 4.6 to play 1,408 Civilization V games from the Stone Age into the future. Here's what we found.](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pux0yc/we_asked_oss120b_and_glm_46_to_play_1408/)

**Author:** u/vox-deorum | **Upvotes:** 626 | **Comments:** 160 | **Date:** 2025-12-24

**Summary:** The post discusses an experiment where open-source LLMs (OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) were used to play 1,408 games of Civilization V. The LLMs showed slightly better performance in best scores but slightly worse in win rates compared to the baseline AI. Notably, the LLMs developed distinct playstyles and could survive full games, a feat not achieved by pure-LLM or pure-RL approaches. Key points include: LLMs played 1,408 full Civilization V games with distinct strategies; OSS-120B favored a warmonger playstyle, while GLM-4.6 was more balanced; Both models preferred the Order ideology over Freedom; The cost per game was approximately $0.86 for OSS-120B; LLMs could survive full games, unlike previous pure-LLM or pure-RL approaches. The discussion highlights enthusiasm for integrating LLMs into multiplayer games and curiosity about the potential of smaller models. Comments also express interest in the broader implications of this research, such as its application to complex problems like the Three-Body Problem.
