## 10. [VTI or VOO is a choice that truly doesn’t matter. But the year is now 2026, and the S&amp;P 500 is a long-outdated investment for buy &amp; hold purposes.](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1q1fy9m/vti_or_voo_is_a_choice_that_truly_doesnt_matter/)

**Author:** u/Kashmir79 | **Upvotes:** 1572 | **Comments:** 291 | **Date:** 2026-01-01

**Summary:** The post argues that choosing between VTI (total US market fund) and VOO (S&P 500 fund) makes little meaningful difference in long-term returns, despite the frequent debate in investing communities.

Key points include: the choice between VTI and VOO is unlikely to significantly impact long-term returns; the S&P 500 was originally created to broadly track the US stock market and has since become a standard benchmark; the debate over VTI vs. VOO is common but ultimately inconsequential for most investors; historical performance of the S&P 500 is statistically indistinguishable from the total US market over long periods; and the post aims to settle the debate by providing a comprehensive explanation. The discussion consensus aligns with the post's argument, emphasizing that the choice between VTI and VOO is largely irrelevant. Top comments reinforce this view, with some humorously suggesting to 'just pick one' or advocating for global diversification (e.g., VT).
