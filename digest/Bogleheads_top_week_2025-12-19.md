## 1. [What so you think of Fidelity's "net worth targets" by age?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pqni6i/what_so_you_think_of_fidelitys_net_worth_targets/)

**Author:** u/HenFruitEater | **Upvotes:** 199 | **Comments:** 144 | **Date:** 2025-12-19

**Summary:** The Reddit post discusses Fidelity's age-based retirement savings benchmarks, which suggest saving 1x salary by 30, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, 8x by 60, and 10x by 67. The post compares these targets to the FIRE community's 25x expenses rule, questioning which is more realistic.

**Key Points:**
- Fidelity's benchmarks are based on current salary and aim for a standard retirement at 65 or later.
- The FIRE community's 25x expenses rule is designed for early retirement, requiring a larger portfolio.
- Fidelity's targets are seen as generic rules of thumb lacking nuance but useful for general guidance.
- Current salary as a metric may not apply well to individuals with varying expenses or income levels.
- The benchmarks assume a savings rate of around 15% and a working period from 21 to 65.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights that Fidelity's benchmarks are considered fine as general guidelines but lack personalization. Users agree that these targets are based on norms and may not apply directly to everyone's unique circumstances. The consensus is that Fidelity's targets are suitable for standard retirement planning, while the FIRE approach is more aggressive for early retirement.

## 6. [Vanguard Final Estimated Year-End 2025 Distributions](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pod994/vanguard_final_estimated_yearend_2025/)

**Author:** u/EevelBob | **Upvotes:** 193 | **Comments:** 21 | **Date:** 2025-12-16

**Summary:** The post discusses Vanguard's final estimated year-end 2025 distributions, explaining that a mutual fund's NAV decreases by the exact amount of the dividend or distribution paid out on the ex-dividend date. This is because the fund returns cash or shares to investors, reducing the fund's total assets.

**Key Points:**
- Mutual fund NAV decreases by the exact amount of the dividend or distribution paid out.
- Dividends are not 'free money' but rather a return of the fund's assets to investors.
- The ex-dividend date is when the NAV adjustment occurs.
- Some investors may not understand why the NAV decreases when the market goes up.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights a common misunderstanding among investors about dividends being 'free money' and the impact of distributions on the fund's NAV. There is also a question about the role of dividends in compounding and redistributing gains in index funds.

**Summary:** A 33-year-old user with a TSP invested entirely in the S&P 500 seeks advice on diversifying their portfolio outside of TSP, expressing interest in VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) and asking if other ETFs should be considered. The discussion largely supports VT as a comprehensive, one-stop solution for global diversification, though some suggest alternatives like VTI and VXUS to balance the user's US-heavy TSP allocation.
