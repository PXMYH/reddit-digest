## 3. [Vanguard Final Estimated Year-End 2025 Distributions](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pod994/vanguard_final_estimated_yearend_2025/)

**Author:** u/EevelBob | **Upvotes:** 194 | **Comments:** 21 | **Date:** 2025-12-16

**Summary:** The post discusses Vanguard's final estimated year-end 2025 distributions, explaining that mutual fund NAV decreases by the exact amount of the dividend or distribution paid out on the ex-dividend date. This is because the fund returns cash or shares to investors, reducing the fund's total assets.

**Key Points:**
- Mutual fund NAV decreases by the exact amount of the dividend or distribution paid out.
- Dividends are not 'free money' but rather a return of the fund's assets to investors.
- The ex-dividend date is when the NAV adjustment occurs.
- Some investors may not understand why the NAV decreases when the market goes up.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights common misconceptions about dividends, with some investors mistakenly believing dividends are free money. There is also a question about whether dividends lead to compounding and increased gains in index funds.

## 4. [Inflation adjusted market returns do not look all that rosy. Am I missing something?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1po0c1o/inflation_adjusted_market_returns_do_not_look_all/)

**Author:** u/volchonok1 | **Upvotes:** 189 | **Comments:** 252 | **Date:** 2025-12-16

**Summary:** The author expresses concern about the long-term viability of stock market investments based on historical inflation-adjusted returns, noting extended periods of flat or negative growth. The discussion highlights the importance of considering dividends and diversification for a more accurate assessment of market performance. Key points include the observation of extended periods of flat or negative growth, the importance of including dividends in return calculations, and the suggestion that a diversified portfolio with dividend reinvestment can yield strong post-inflation returns. The consensus among commenters is that the author's analysis may be incomplete without considering dividends and diversification, and that a well-diversified portfolio with dividend reinvestment can provide strong inflation-adjusted returns over the long term.

## 5. [VT and Chill?](https://reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1pmrbbp/vt_and_chill/)

**Author:** u/tryingmybesttolearn2 | **Upvotes:** 133 | **Comments:** 71 | **Date:** 2025-12-14

**Summary:** The post discusses the use of VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) as a primary investment, with the author seeking advice on whether to include other ETFs. The consensus in the comments supports VT as a comprehensive, one-stop solution for global equity exposure.

**Key Points:**
- VT is designed to be a comprehensive, one-stop shop for total domestic and international index exposure.
- Adding more equity-tracking ETFs on top of VT is unnecessary if VT is the chosen investment.
- The author's TSP is heavily invested in the S&P 500, which may lead to an overweight in US stocks if VT is added.
- Alternatives like VTI and VXUS are suggested to balance the portfolio, depending on the size of the S&P 500 investment.
- The 'VT and chill' strategy is considered a low-maintenance approach, similar to using a target date fund.

**Discussion Highlights:** The discussion highlights a strong consensus around the simplicity and effectiveness of the 'VT and chill' strategy. However, some commenters caution about potential overweight in US stocks due to the author's existing S&P 500 investment in their TSP. Alternatives like VTI and VXUS are suggested for better portfolio balance.

**Key Points:**

- The maximum annual 401k contribution limit is now $23,500, similar to the growth of the $200 investment.
