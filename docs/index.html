                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses the ongoing debate among Bogleheads about the adequacy of US-only equity investments in light of potential shifts in global trade and market access, referencing Mark Carney&#x27;s speech at Davos. The discussion highlights varying perspectives on whether to maintain a US-only approach or diversify internationally. Key points include the historical argument for US-only equities being challenged by new global paradigms, investors considering increasing focus on international equities, and a mix of steadfastness in US-only investments and openness to global diversification. The discussion shows a divide between those advocating for staying the course with US-only equities and those who have diversified internationally for peace of mind.

                <div class="post-summary">The post questions why buying a house is discouraged as a way to preserve money, even if some capital is recovered upon sale, compared to renting where all payments are lost. The discussion explores the nuances of homeownership costs, investment perspectives, and personal factors.</div>
                <div class="key-points">
                    <h4>Key Points</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Buying a house is not considered a good investment due to low returns, high costs, and opportunity costs compared to index funds.</li>
                        <li>The author struggles with the idea that buying allows partial capital recovery, unlike renting where all payments are lost.</li>
                        <li>Top comments suggest that homeownership is not purely an investment and depends on individual circumstances, costs, and market conditions.</li>
                        <li>Realistic cost comparisons, including taxes, maintenance, and transaction costs, are crucial in the buying vs. renting decision.</li>
                        <li>Bogleheads generally do not discourage buying if mortgage and maintenance costs are lower than renting.</li>

                    <h4>Discussion Highlights</h4>
                    <p>The discussion highlights that while buying a house may not be a great investment, it is not universally discouraged, especially if costs are lower than renting. Personal factors, realistic cost comparisons, and individual preferences play a significant role in the decision. The consensus is that renting is not necessarily worse than buying, and the choice depends on various factors.</p>

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses the author&#x27;s confusion about the prevalence of ETF discussions over mutual funds, despite their similarities. The comments highlight key differences such as trading flexibility and fees, with a general consensus that ETFs are more popular due to their accessibility and lower costs. Key points include: ETFs can be traded in real-time during market hours, while mutual funds are traded at the end of the day; ETFs are generally more accessible and easier to recommend across different brokers; mutual funds may have behavioral advantages by limiting intra-day trading; ETFs often have lower fees compared to mutual funds; and the popularity of ETFs is driven by their flexibility and cost-effectiveness. The discussion highlights the practical differences between ETFs and mutual funds, with a consensus that ETFs are favored for their trading flexibility, lower fees, and broader accessibility. However, mutual funds are noted for their behavioral benefits, such as reducing impulsive trading.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses whether holding VTI and VXUS together, which cover more stocks than VT alone, is a better &#x27;total world&#x27; ETF strategy. The discussion highlights the trade-offs between broader coverage and simplicity. Key points include: VTI + VXUS combined hold 12,158 stocks, while VT holds 9,950 stocks; the extra 2,208 stocks in VTI + VXUS are likely global microcaps with minimal impact on returns; VT is often preferred for its simplicity and ease of management, despite covering fewer stocks; holding VTI + VXUS requires rebalancing, which adds complexity; and the cost and effort of managing more stocks may not justify the marginal benefits. The consensus leans towards VT for its simplicity and lower maintenance, even though VTI + VXUS technically cover more stocks. Users appreciate the ease of a single fund and are willing to forgo the additional stocks for convenience.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses the ongoing debate among Bogleheads about the adequacy of US-only equity investments in light of potential shifts in global trade and market access, referencing Mark Carney&#x27;s speech at Davos. The discussion highlights varying perspectives on whether to maintain a US-only approach or diversify internationally. Key points include the historical argument for US-only equities being challenged by new global paradigms, investors considering increasing focus on international equities, and a mix of steadfastness in US-only investments and openness to global diversification. The discussion shows a divide between those advocating for staying the course with US-only equities and those who have diversified internationally for peace of mind.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses strategies for contributing exactly the 401K limit of $24,500, considering employer matching and variable bonuses. The author seeks advice on how to manage contributions to avoid missing out on employer matching due to overshooting the limit. Key points include: Employer contributions do not count toward the $24,500 limit; employers may offer &#x27;true up&#x27; to cover missed matching contributions if the limit is reached early; without &#x27;true up,&#x27; employees need to adjust contributions periodically to hit the limit accurately; some 401K plans offer &#x27;After Tax&#x27; contributions, which can be rolled over into a Roth; and payroll systems typically cap contributions at the federal limit. The discussion highlights that employer contributions are separate from the federal limit and suggests strategies like overshooting contributions if &#x27;true up&#x27; is available. Consensus indicates that periodic adjustments are necessary for precise contributions, and some plans offer additional contribution options like &#x27;After Tax.&#x27;

                <div class="post-summary">The post argues that the choice between VTI (total US market fund) and VOO (S&amp;P 500 fund) is largely inconsequential for long-term investors, as both have historically delivered similar returns.

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses why individuals with substantial wealth (e.g., over $3 million) choose to rent instead of buying a home, highlighting flexibility, lower costs in high-cost areas, and avoidance of maintenance responsibilities. The discussion also touches on the benefits of buying, such as stability for families, but ultimately leans towards renting as a more practical choice in certain circumstances. Key points include flexibility, lower costs, stability for families, and the influence of personal circumstances. The discussion highlights a strong preference for renting among financially independent individuals, particularly due to the flexibility, lower opportunity cost, and avoidance of maintenance. However, some acknowledge the benefits of buying for long-term stability, especially for families. The overall consensus is that renting is often the more practical choice in high-cost areas and for those who prioritize mobility and financial liquidity.

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses the use of abliteration to reduce &#x27;slop&#x27; (flowery, cliched language) in LLM outputs, specifically for the Mistral Nemo model. The author created a configuration file that leverages abliteration to produce a slop-reduced version of the model without fine-tuning, demonstrating its effectiveness through comparative outputs. Key points include the technique&#x27;s ability to reduce slop without training, the creation of a configuration file for this purpose, and mixed opinions on whether the technique improves output quality or makes it overly dry. The discussion highlights mixed opinions on the effectiveness of the technique, with some users appreciating the reduction in slop while others feel it makes the prose overly dry. There is also interest in the potential for this technique to address other overused patterns in LLM outputs.

                <div class="post-summary">Researchers used open-source LLMs (GPT-OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) to play 1,408 full games of Civilization V with a hybrid approach, achieving survival rates comparable to the in-game AI. The LLMs developed distinct playstyles, with OSS-120B favoring warmongering and GLM-4.6 adopting a balanced strategy. The cost per game was approximately $0.86, with input tokens scaling linearly as the game progressed. Key points include: LLMs played full Civilization V games with a hybrid approach, achieving survival rates similar to the in-game AI; OSS-120B exhibited a warmongering playstyle, while GLM-4.6 played more balanced; Both models preferred the Order ideology over Freedom; The cost per game was around $0.86, with input tokens scaling linearly; The study involved 2,207 games in total, with 919 baseline games. Discussion highlights: The discussion highlighted enthusiasm for integrating LLMs into multiplayer games and curiosity about the potential of smaller models. Users expressed interest in playing against local models and exploring more complex AI behaviors.
