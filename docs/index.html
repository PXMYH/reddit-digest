                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post highlights that the concept of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) is still relatively unknown to most people, as demonstrated by a colleague&#x27;s surprise at the possibility of retiring in one&#x27;s late 30s. The post emphasizes the power of compounding and the impact of saving a significant portion of one&#x27;s income. Key points include: FIRE is an obscure concept to many people outside specific circles like tech and finance; the power of compounding and saving 20-25% of income can significantly reduce the timeline to financial freedom; many people are financially illiterate or indifferent to the idea of early retirement; retiring in one&#x27;s late 30s is considered outside the norm for most people; spreading awareness about FIRE can potentially change lives. The discussion highlights a consensus that FIRE is not widely known or understood, with many people focusing on living for today rather than planning for early retirement. There is also an acknowledgment that financial literacy and the ability to save vary greatly among individuals.

                <div class="post-summary">The author inherited a large DRIP account in UPS stock (~1290 shares + $65K cash) from their late mother, discovered through unclaimed property. They seek advice on whether to reinstate the shares or liquidate them, given their financial situation (mid-30s, $100K job, $47K student loans). Key points include the unknown DRIP account, the author&#x27;s plan to pay off student loans and invest aggressively, and the discussion&#x27;s emphasis on diversification and professional advice. The consensus leans towards diversifying out of UPS into broader index funds, paying off student loans partially or fully, and consulting a financial advisor due to potential tax implications.
