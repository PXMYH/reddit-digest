                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post compares a Buy-&amp;-Hold strategy with a Fear-Based strategy for investing in SPY over 22 years. The Fear-Based strategy, which sells SPY when economic anxiety peaks and moves to short-term treasuries, shows slightly higher returns but lower drawdowns. However, after accounting for taxes, the Buy-&amp;-Hold strategy performs better. Key points include the performance comparison, the impact of taxes, and the practical challenges of implementing a fear-based strategy. The discussion highlights concerns about back-testing bias and the feasibility of timing the market based on fear.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses an experiment where open-source LLMs (OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) were used to play 1,408 full games of Civilization V. The LLMs showed slightly better performance in best scores but slightly worse win rates compared to the baseline. Notably, the LLMs developed distinct playstyles and could survive full games, a feat not achieved by pure-LLM or pure-RL approaches. Key points include: LLMs played 1,408 full Civilization V games with distinct playstyles; OSS-120B favored a warmonger strategy, while GLM-4.6 was more balanced; Both models preferred the Order ideology over Freedom; The cost per game was approximately $0.86 for OSS-120B; LLMs could survive full games, unlike previous pure-LLM or pure-RL approaches. The discussion highlights enthusiasm for integrating LLMs into multiplayer games and curiosity about the potential of smaller models. Comments also express interest in the broader implications of this research, such as its application to complex problems like the Three-Body Problem.

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses the current state of sparse-MoE&#x27;s for agentic coding work, focusing on evaluations and model comparisons. Users debate the effectiveness of different models, with some highlighting limitations in long-context tasks. Key points include: evaluation methods for sparse-MoE&#x27;s are questioned, GPT-OSS-120B is noted for its limitations in long-context tasks, Qwen3-Next 80B is mentioned as a potential superior model, and model performance varies significantly in agentic coding tasks. The discussion highlights a lack of consensus on the best model for agentic coding tasks, with users citing specific performance issues and preferences. GPT-OSS-120B is criticized for breaking down beyond 64K context, while Qwen3-Next 80B is suggested as a strong alternative.

Users find it ironic that while energy drinks are restricted, other potentially harmful sponsorships (like gambling) are not.</p>
