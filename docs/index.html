The comments generally support VT as a comprehensive, one-stop solution for global equity exposure.</div>

                <div class="post-summary">The post highlights that the concept of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) is still relatively unknown to most people, as demonstrated by a colleague&#x27;s surprise at the possibility of retiring in one&#x27;s late 30s. The author emphasizes the power of compounding and the impact of saving a significant portion of one&#x27;s income. Key points include the obscurity of FIRE, the power of compounding, lack of awareness about early retirement, and the prioritization of living for today over planning for early retirement. The discussion highlights a general lack of awareness about FIRE, with many people not considering early retirement as a viable option, and a consensus that financial literacy is low.
