The author shares their own rules they break while maintaining a strong financial position ($830k at 33). Key points include: FIRE is about prioritizing what you care about most, not just being cheap; many individuals do not follow strict budgeting but rely on discipline and automatic investments; paying down mortgages quickly is a common priority for peace of mind; practical spending on long-term items and experiences is valued over extreme frugality; and FIRE involves breaking societal norms and finding personal financial strategies. The discussion highlights a consensus that FIRE is more about prioritizing personal values and financial independence rather than strict frugality.

                <div class="post-summary">Researchers used open-source LLMs (GPT-OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) to play 1,408 Civilization V games, finding that LLMs can survive full games with a hybrid approach and develop distinct playstyles. The models showed slight performance improvements but no significant advantage over algorithmic AI. Key points include: LLMs can survive full Civilization V games with a hybrid approach; OSS-120B favored a warmonger playstyle, while GLM-4.6 was more balanced; Both models preferred the Order ideology over Freedom; Cost per game was approximately $0.86 for OSS-120B; Models as small as OSS-20B can perform effectively. The community expressed excitement about the potential for local models to play against humans and curiosity about how LLMs might adapt to civilization leaders&#x27; personas. Some users questioned the practical takeaways from the experiment.
