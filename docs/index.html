                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses whether investors should reconsider their allocation to US equities in light of potential shifts in global trade and market access, referencing a speech by Mark Carney. The discussion highlights varying perspectives on maintaining a US-focused portfolio versus diversifying internationally. Key points include the historical argument for US-focused funds being challenged, Mark Carney&#x27;s speech suggesting a shift away from free trade, and debates on increasing focus on international equities. The discussion reflects a mix of opinions, with some advocating for maintaining a steady course in US equities, while others suggest diversifying globally. A notable consensus is the difficulty of timing market changes and the preference for a globally weighted or market-cap-based approach.

                <div class="post-summary">The post questions why buying a house is not considered a good way to preserve money, even if mortgage payments are lower than rent. The discussion highlights various perspectives on the financial and personal aspects of homeownership versus renting.</div>
                <div class="key-points">
                    <h4>Key Points</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Buying a house is not considered a good investment due to low or uncertain real returns, high transaction costs, taxes, maintenance, and opportunity cost versus index funds.</li>
                        <li>The author struggles to understand why buying is discouraged even as a way to preserve money, given that some portion of the money can be recovered upon selling the house.</li>
                        <li>Top comments suggest that Bogleheads do not universally discourage homeownership, especially if mortgage and maintenance costs are lower than rent.</li>
                        <li>Personal factors such as individual needs, market conditions, and risk appetite play a significant role in the decision to buy or rent.</li>
                        <li>Realistic assessment of homeownership costs, including property taxes, maintenance, and unexpected expenses, is crucial for a fair comparison.</li>

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses whether holding both VTI and VXUS provides a more comprehensive &#x27;total world&#x27; ETF than VT alone, noting that VTI + VXUS hold more stocks. The discussion highlights the trade-offs between the number of stocks, ease of management, and the impact on returns. Key points include: VTI + VXUS combined hold 12,158 stocks, while VT holds 9,950 stocks; the extra 2,208 stocks in VTI + VXUS are likely global microcaps with minimal impact on returns; VT is preferred for its simplicity and lower management hassle; proper weighting of VTI and VXUS is crucial for it to be considered a true &#x27;total world&#x27; ETF; and cost and AUM considerations may explain why VT holds fewer stocks. The consensus leans towards VT for its simplicity and ease of management, despite holding fewer stocks. Some users argue that VTI + VXUS, when properly weighted, can be a more comprehensive option, but the additional stocks may not significantly impact returns. The discussion also touches on the cost and practicality of managing multiple funds.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses whether investors should reconsider their allocation to US equities in light of potential shifts in global trade and market access, referencing a speech by Mark Carney. The discussion highlights varying perspectives on maintaining a US-focused portfolio versus diversifying internationally. Key points include the historical argument for US-focused funds being challenged, Mark Carney&#x27;s speech suggesting a shift away from free trade, and debates on increasing focus on international equities. The discussion reflects a mix of opinions, with some advocating for maintaining a steady course in US equities, while others suggest diversifying globally. A notable consensus is the difficulty of timing market changes and the preference for a globally weighted or market-cap-based approach.

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses how the concept of Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) is unfamiliar in the author&#x27;s European country, where people rely on government pensions and have limited understanding of investing. The discussion highlights cultural differences in financial planning and attitudes towards work and retirement. Key points include the alien nature of FIRE in many countries, reliance on government pensions, lack of understanding of investing, cultural attitudes prioritizing immediate gratification, and a potential shift in financial awareness among younger generations. The comments indicate that the lack of awareness about FIRE is not unique to the author&#x27;s country, with similar attitudes observed in the US and other European countries. There is a consensus that wealth accumulation is a relatively new concept in many European countries, and while the current generation may not widely adopt FIRE, there is hope for a shift in mindset among younger generations like Gen Z.

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post presents performance benchmarks for various language models run on a system with three RTX 3090 GPUs and 72GB VRAM. The benchmarks measure tokens per second for each model, with ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-Thinking-Q8_0 achieving the highest speed at 147.85 tokens/s. The author notes that the setup uses default configurations and that smaller models may perform better with fewer GPUs. Key points include the hardware setup, performance metrics, and suggestions for further testing and optimization. Commenters suggest additional testing with larger context sizes and different configurations, and discuss the benefits of using specific flags during compilation to improve performance.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses an experiment where open-source LLMs (GPT-OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) were used to play 1,408 games of Civilization V. The LLMs showed slightly better performance in best scores but slightly worse in win rates compared to the baseline AI. Notably, the LLMs developed distinct playstyles and could survive full games, a feat not achieved by pure-LLM or pure-RL approaches. Key points include: LLMs played 1,408 full Civilization V games with distinct strategies; LLMs showed slight improvements in best scores but slight declines in win rates; OSS-120B favored a warmonger playstyle, while GLM-4.6 was more balanced; Both models preferred the Order ideology over Freedom; The cost per game was approximately $0.86 for OSS-120B. The discussion highlights enthusiasm for integrating LLMs into multiplayer games and curiosity about the potential of smaller models. Comments also reflect interest in the broader implications of AI in gaming and the uniqueness of the approach.
