                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses whether taxes will be higher in the future, with many commenters noting that current tax rates are historically low and could increase. However, some argue that future tax rates are unknowable, similar to predicting the stock market. Key points include: Taxes are currently at historical lows and could rise in the future; Future tax rates are uncertain, much like stock market predictions; Some retirees have benefited from lower taxes in retirement compared to their earning years; The national deficit and debt may influence future tax policies; Roth conversions and RMD strategies are discussed as ways to manage potential tax increases. The discussion highlights a general consensus that while taxes could rise due to historical trends and fiscal pressures, predicting future tax rates remains uncertain. Many commenters emphasize the importance of saving and strategic financial planning regardless of tax expectations.
