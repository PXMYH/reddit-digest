                <div class="post-summary">The post argues that choosing between VTI (total US market fund) and VOO (S&amp;P 500 fund) makes little meaningful difference in long-term returns, as both have historically delivered similar performance.

                        <li>The S&amp;P 500 was originally created to broadly track the US stock market and has since become a standard benchmark.</li>
                        <li>Historically, the S&amp;P 500 and total US market funds have delivered statistically indistinguishable returns.</li>
                        <li>The debate between VTI and VOO is considered overblown, with minimal impact on long-term investment outcomes.</li>
                        <li>The S&amp;P 500 is often recommended by figures like Warren Buffett, but total market funds include small caps, which some consider &#x27;junk&#x27;.</li>

                    <p>The discussion consensus aligns with the post&#x27;s argument, emphasizing that the choice between VTI and VOO is largely inconsequential. Top comments reinforce this, with one noting that the S&amp;P 500&#x27;s performance is statistically indistinguishable from the total market. Another comment humorously suggests expanding the discussion to include global funds like VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF).</p>

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses the expectations and realities of inheritance among individuals aged 25-30, highlighting the uncertainty and unpredictability of receiving an inheritance. Key points include: never expect an inheritance even if promised one due to unforeseen circumstances like medical costs or bad investments; elder care expenses can significantly reduce or deplete expected inheritances; some view the absence of student loans as a form of inheritance; inheritances are uncertain and should not be relied upon until received; personal experiences vary widely, with some receiving minimal or no inheritance. The discussion consensus emphasizes the unpredictability of inheritances, with many commenters advising against relying on expected inheritances due to various potential financial drains and life uncertainties.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses whether average workers can achieve FIRE with $5+ million, highlighting that many successful FIRE individuals come from high-income careers or business ownership. The discussion explores alternative paths to FIRE with lower savings targets. Key points include: Most FIRE individuals with $5+ million are high-income earners or business owners. Some commenters argue that $5 million is not necessary for FIRE, with targets like $1.5 million being sufficient. Key strategies for FIRE include avoiding debt, maximizing retirement accounts, paying off housing, and living below one&#x27;s means. Income levels significantly impact the required savings for FIRE, with lower-income individuals needing less. Personal experiences shared include retiring with less than $5 million and emphasizing frugality. The discussion highlights a consensus that FIRE is achievable with varying savings amounts depending on income level and lifestyle. Many emphasize the importance of frugality, debt avoidance, and consistent investing over high income alone.

                <div class="post-summary">The ik_llama.cpp project achieved a significant performance breakthrough for multi-GPU setups, delivering a 3x to 4x speed improvement in local LLM inference. This advancement allows for the use of multiple low-cost GPUs instead of expensive high-end cards, making it a game-changer for homelabs, server rooms, and cloud setups. Key points include the 3x to 4x speed improvement, the new execution mode enabling maximum utilization of multiple GPUs, cost-effectiveness, performance improvements in single GPU and CPU-only setups, and competitiveness with other performance-optimized forks. The community is excited about the performance gains and cost-effectiveness, with some users reporting bottlenecks in hybrid inference setups.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses optimizing a ThinkPad P15 with 32GB RAM and an 8GB Quadro GPU to run large language models efficiently. By using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model with all experts on the CPU and leveraging the Granite 4.0 Small model, the user achieved high context lengths and usable generation speeds. Key points include using a MoE model with experts on CPU to free up VRAM, Granite 4.0 Small maintaining speed with large context sizes, achieving ~7 tokens per second with a 50-page context, comparisons with other models like Qwen 30B A3B and GPT-OSS-20B, and mentions of Vulkan inference and cache rebuilding issues. The discussion highlights comparisons with other models, performance metrics with different hardware setups, and suggestions to increase speed by adjusting the number of MoE weights in Jan.
