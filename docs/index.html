                    <p>The consensus leans toward the idea that while a 100% VT portfolio can be effective, its suitability depends heavily on an investor&#x27;s risk tolerance and life stage.

                <div class="post-summary">Yann LeCun confirmed that Llama 4 benchmarks were manipulated, and Meta&#x27;s AI division faced significant restructuring, leading to departures and a lack of follow-up on promised models. The community expressed disappointment and shared additional resources. Key points include: LeCun confirmed Llama 4 benchmark manipulation, Meta&#x27;s AI division was restructured, leading to departures, no follow-up on the promised large Llama 4 model, community disappointment in Meta&#x27;s handling of Llama, and additional resources shared for further reading. The discussion highlighted disappointment in Meta&#x27;s strategic decisions, with users sharing additional resources and questioning how a well-positioned organization could falter while smaller labs thrived.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses finding the most optimal GPU setup with high VRAM (48GB-96GB) for local models and occasional PyTorch training within a $1500-3000 budget in the Shenzhen market. Users recommend options like the MI100 for best performance per dollar (non-CUDA), 4090D 48GB for CUDA support, and A100 40GB as alternatives. Key points include the budget range, VRAM requirements, top recommendations, considerations for cooling and modded cards, and the need to verify market prices. The discussion highlights a consensus around the MI100 for best value if CUDA is not required, while the 4090D 48GB is recommended for CUDA support.
