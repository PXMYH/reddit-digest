                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses whether taxes will be higher in the future, with mixed opinions from commenters. Some argue that taxes are historically low and could rise, while others emphasize the unpredictability of future tax rates. Key points include: taxes are currently at historical lows and could increase, future tax rates are unpredictable, some retirees report lower taxes now compared to their earning years, the national deficit and debt may influence future tax policies, and Roth conversions and RMD strategies are discussed as ways to manage tax liabilities. The discussion highlights a divide between those who believe taxes will rise due to historical trends and fiscal pressures, and those who view future tax rates as unknowable. Many commenters share personal strategies for managing retirement withdrawals and tax liabilities.

It explores whether a larger financial cushion provides peace of mind or if a higher withdrawal rate is worth the risk. Key points include the conservative nature of the 4% rule, the increased risk of higher withdrawal rates, and the role of personal circumstances in retirement decisions. The discussion highlights a divide between those prioritizing financial security and those willing to take on more risk for earlier retirement.

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses how GLM 4.7 is more censored compared to 4.6, with users noting differences in behavior and performance, particularly in creative writing tasks. Key points include: GLM 4.7 is perceived as more censored than 4.6; users report that 4.6 was better for adult writing and creative tasks; some users experienced gaslighting behavior from GLM 4.7; the local version of GLM 4.7 may not be censored, but provider versions might be; and GLM 4.7 is considered a misfire for creative writing and personality prompting. The discussion highlights a consensus that GLM 4.7 is more censored and less effective for creative writing compared to previous versions. Users suggest that the local version may not have the same censorship issues as provider versions.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses a shift in open weight models towards larger, less locally accessible models, making it difficult for local users to run them without significant hardware upgrades. The author advocates for a return to smaller, domain-specific models that can be run locally with limited resources. Key points include the shift to larger models, the impact on local users, and the suggestion to focus on smaller, domain-specific models. The discussion highlights recent model releases that buck the trend towards larger models and debates the feasibility of returning to smaller models.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses an experiment where open-source LLMs (OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) were used to play 1,408 games of Civilization V. The LLMs showed slightly better performance in best scores but slightly worse in win rates compared to the baseline AI. Interestingly, the LLMs developed distinct playstyles and could survive full games, a feat not achieved by pure-LLM or pure-RL approaches. Key points include: LLMs played 1,408 full Civilization V games with distinct strategies; OSS-120B favored a warmonger playstyle, while GLM-4.6 was more balanced; Both models preferred the &#x27;Order&#x27; ideology over &#x27;Freedom&#x27;; Cost per game was approximately $0.86 for OSS-120B; LLMs could survive full games, unlike previous pure-LLM or pure-RL approaches. The discussion highlights enthusiasm for integrating LLMs into multiplayer games and curiosity about the potential of smaller models. Comments also reflect interest in the broader implications of this research, such as its application to complex simulations like the &#x27;Three-Body Problem&#x27;.
