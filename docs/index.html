                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses the possibility of a &#x27;lost decade&#x27; for US equities and whether it should influence investment planning. The discussion highlights the importance of international diversification and the role of valuation metrics like PE ratios in predicting future returns. Key points include the recommendation for international diversification to mitigate risks associated with high US equity valuations, the meaningfulness of PE ratios for predicting future returns, the unpredictability of market outcomes, the common pitfall of recency bias in investment discussions, and the potential impact of technological progress and earnings growth on market trajectories. The consensus leans towards the importance of diversification and the limitations of predictive models, with many commenters stressing the uncertainty of market outcomes and the value of a globally diversified portfolio to manage risks.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Fidelity&#x27;s benchmarks are based on current salary, not net worth.</li>
                        <li>The benchmarks are: By 30 (1x salary), By 40 (3x salary), By 50 (6x salary), By 60 (8x salary), By 67 (10x salary).</li>
                        <li>The benchmarks are considered rules of thumb and lack nuance.</li>
                        <li>The FIRE community&#x27;s 25x expenses rule is aimed at early retirement, requiring a larger portfolio.</li>
                        <li>The benchmarks are more applicable to standard retirement at 65 or later.</li>

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses Monte Carlo success rates for those who have achieved FIRE, with the author questioning if a 92% success rate is sufficient given the consequences of failure. Key points include the idea that a 92% success rate does not necessarily mean an 8% chance of failure, the importance of flexibility in budgeting, and the general consensus that success rates above 80% are often deemed sufficient by financial planners. The discussion highlights the need for flexibility and personal circumstances in financial planning.

                <div class="post-summary">Researchers used open-source LLMs (GPT-OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) to play 1,408 full games of Civilization V, finding that LLMs can survive full games and develop distinct playstyles. The LLMs performed slightly better in best scores but worse in win rates compared to baseline AI. Key points include: LLMs can survive full Civilization V games with a hybrid approach; OSS-120B favored a warmonger playstyle, while GLM-4.6 was more balanced; Both models preferred the Order ideology over Freedom; Cost per game was approximately $0.86 for OSS-120B; The study involved 2,207 games in total, with 919 baseline games. The community expressed excitement about the potential for LLMs to play Civilization V, with comments highlighting interest in playing against local models and integrating LLMs into multiplayer games. Some users also inquired about the impact of model size on performance.

                <div class="post-summary">The FIA has closed a technical loophole in the 2026 engine regulations involving the manipulation of the fuel flow meter temperature to cheat the energy flow sensor. The Reddit discussion highlights a debate on whether such regulations improve competition or stifle engineering innovation. Key points include: the loophole involves cheating the energy flow sensor, it is related to manipulating the fuel flow meter temperature, the community is divided on the impact of such regulations on competition, and the loophole is technical and not about compression ratio. The consensus is that the loophole is technical and not about compression ratio, with a debate on whether such regulations improve or hinder competition, and some users expressing concerns about dominance by a single engine manufacturer.
