                <div class="post-summary">The post questions the common belief that taxes will be higher in the future, noting that this hasn&#x27;t necessarily been true over the past 20-30 years. The discussion highlights varying perspectives on future tax rates, with some arguing that taxes are historically low and could rise, while others emphasize the unpredictability of future tax policies. Key points include: Taxes are currently at historical lows and could increase in the future; Future tax rates are uncertain, similar to market predictions; Some retirees have experienced lower taxes in retirement compared to their working years; The national deficit and debt may influence future tax policies; Roth conversions and RMD strategies are discussed as ways to manage tax liabilities. The discussion reveals a mix of opinions, with some users expecting higher taxes due to historical trends and fiscal pressures, while others stress the unpredictability of future tax policies. A consensus emerges around the importance of saving and strategic tax planning, such as Roth conversions, to mitigate potential future tax increases.
