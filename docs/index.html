                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post highlights that the concept of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) is still relatively unknown to most people, as demonstrated by a colleague&#x27;s surprise at the possibility of retiring in one&#x27;s late 30s. The post emphasizes the power of compounding and the impact of saving a significant portion of one&#x27;s income. Key points include: FIRE is an obscure concept to many people outside specific circles like tech and finance; the power of compounding and saving 20-25% of income can significantly reduce the timeline to financial freedom; many people are financially illiterate or indifferent to the idea of early retirement; retiring in one&#x27;s late 30s is considered outside the norm for most people; spreading awareness of FIRE can potentially change lives, though it may not be relevant or interesting to everyone. The discussion highlights a general consensus that FIRE is not widely known or understood outside certain professional circles. Many commenters note that financial literacy is low among the general population, and that the idea of early retirement is often met with surprise or disbelief. There is also an acknowledgment that while spreading awareness of FIRE can be beneficial, it may not resonate with everyone.
