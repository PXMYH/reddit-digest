                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post highlights that the concept of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) is still relatively unknown to most people, as demonstrated by a colleague&#x27;s surprise at the possibility of retiring in one&#x27;s late 30s. The discussion emphasizes the power of compounding and the impact of saving a significant portion of one&#x27;s income.</div>

                    <ul>
                        <li>FIRE is an obscure concept to many people outside specific circles like tech and finance.</li>
                        <li>The power of compounding and saving 20-25% of income can significantly reduce the timeline to financial freedom.</li>
                        <li>Many people do not make enough money to save significantly, making FIRE unattainable for some.</li>
                        <li>Financial literacy and interest in early retirement vary widely among individuals.</li>
                        <li>Spreading awareness about FIRE can potentially change lives, but it is often met with surprise or disbelief.</li>
