                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post highlights that the concept of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) is still relatively unknown to most people, as demonstrated by a colleague&#x27;s surprise at their boss retiring in his late 30s. The post emphasizes the power of compounding and the impact of saving a significant portion of one&#x27;s income. Key points include the obscurity of FIRE, the power of compounding, and the lack of awareness about early retirement. The discussion highlights that while FIRE is a powerful concept, it is not widely understood or practiced, and spreading awareness can be life-changing.
