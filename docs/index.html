                <div class="post-summary">The post argues that choosing between VTI (total US market fund) and VOO (S&amp;P 500 fund) makes little meaningful difference in long-term returns, despite the frequent debate in investing communities. It provides historical context on the S&amp;P 500&#x27;s origins and evolution. Key points include: the choice between VTI and VOO is unlikely to significantly impact long-term returns; the S&amp;P 500 was originally created to broadly track the US stock market and has since become a standard benchmark; the debate over VTI vs. VOO is common but ultimately inconsequential for most investors; historical performance of the S&amp;P 500 is statistically indistinguishable from the total US market over long periods; and the post aims to settle the debate by providing a comprehensive explanation. The discussion consensus aligns with the post&#x27;s argument, emphasizing that the choice between VTI and VOO is largely irrelevant. Top comments reinforce this view, with some humorously suggesting to &#x27;just pick one&#x27; or advocating for global diversification (e.g., VT).
