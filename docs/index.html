                <div class="post-summary">A 35-year-old investor is seeking advice on whether to include a small percentage of bonds in their portfolio.

                    <h4>Key Points</h4>

                        <li>The investor is just starting out and plans to contribute the maximum each year.</li>
                        <li>Some commenters suggest considering the current portfolio size relative to the target retirement portfolio.</li>
                        <li>Vanguard&#x27;s model portfolio allocation is referenced as a guide for bond inclusion.</li>
                        <li>There are two main schools of thought: early bond ramp-up vs. later inclusion.</li>
                        <li>A common recommendation is the &#x27;120 - your age&#x27; rule for stock allocation, implying some bond inclusion.</li>

                    <h4>Discussion Highlights</h4>
                    <p>The discussion reveals a consensus around the idea of including a small percentage of bonds (e.g., 10-15%) at age 35, with references to Vanguard&#x27;s guidelines and target-date funds. However, there is also a perspective that the difference in yield between a 100% stock portfolio and a 90/10 portfolio is minimal, suggesting that stability may not justify the slight reduction in returns.</p>

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post questions whether tech professionals in their 30s commonly have $3M in savings, with mixed responses from commenters. Some argue it&#x27;s rare, while others cite high salaries and stock options in tech as potential pathways to such wealth. Key points include the debate on the normality of such savings, the role of high salaries and stock options, and personal anecdotes of significant wealth accumulation. The discussion highlights a divide between those who see $3M in savings by one&#x27;s 30s as an outlier and those who acknowledge it as possible in tech, especially with high salaries, stock options, and early career success. The consensus leans toward such savings being rare but achievable in specific circumstances.
