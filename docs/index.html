                <div class="post-summary">The author questions the effectiveness of long-term stock market investments due to periods of flat or negative inflation-adjusted returns, expressing concern about future market performance. Key points include long periods of stagnation or decline in inflation-adjusted S&amp;P 500 returns, market growth concentrated in specific periods, and the importance of considering dividends and diversified portfolios for better inflation-adjusted returns. The discussion emphasizes the importance of including dividends and considering diversified portfolios for accurate inflation-adjusted returns, with many commenters arguing that stocks remain a viable option for beating inflation over the long term, despite periods of stagnation.

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses the user&#x27;s interest in VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) as a one-stop solution for their portfolio outside of their TSP, which is entirely invested in the S&amp;P 500. The comments largely support the &#x27;VT and chill&#x27; approach, emphasizing its simplicity and comprehensiveness. Key points include: VT is designed to be a one-stop shop for total domestic and international index investing; the &#x27;VT and chill&#x27; approach is widely supported as a simple and effective strategy; the user&#x27;s TSP being entirely in the S&amp;P 500 may lead to an overweight in US stocks if VT is added; some commenters suggest using VTI and VXUS to approximate VT while balancing the US overweight; VT is considered the ultimate chill strategy, similar to a target date fund. The discussion highlights a strong consensus around the &#x27;VT and chill&#x27; approach, with many commenters endorsing VT as a comprehensive and simple solution. However, there is also a consideration for balancing the user&#x27;s portfolio to avoid an overweight in US stocks due to their TSP investment in the S&amp;P 500. Some commenters suggest using a combination of VTI and VXUS to achieve a similar balance to VT while addressing the US overweight.
