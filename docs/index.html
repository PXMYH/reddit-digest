                <div class="post-summary">The author shares their experience of realizing that having &#x27;coast money&#x27; (enough to retire comfortably) changes their behavior at work, making it difficult to continue coasting without financial incentives. The discussion highlights the challenges of coasting and the importance of asserting oneself when financially independent.</div>

                    <h4>Key Points</h4>

                        <li>Coasting for 2 years was the initial plan, but financial independence led to a shift in work behavior.</li>
                        <li>Losing financial incentives makes coasting difficult and leads to assertiveness at work.</li>
                        <li>The discussion suggests that coasting is easier when closer to full FIRE rather than needing more years of market returns.</li>
