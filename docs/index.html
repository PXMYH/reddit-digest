                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses an experiment where open-source LLMs (OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) were used to play 1,408 games of Civilization V. The LLMs showed slightly better performance in best scores but worse in win rates compared to the baseline AI. Notably, the LLMs developed distinct playstyles and could survive full games, a feat previously unattainable with pure-LLM or pure-RL approaches. Key points include: LLMs played 1,408 full Civilization V games with distinct strategies; OSS-120B favored a warmonger playstyle, while GLM-4.6 was more balanced; Both models preferred the Order ideology over Freedom; The cost per game was approximately $0.86 for OSS-120B; LLMs could survive full games, a significant improvement over previous methods. The discussion highlights enthusiasm for integrating LLMs into multiplayer games and curiosity about the potential of smaller models. Comments also reflect interest in the broader implications of this research, such as applications in complex simulations like the Three-Body Problem.

                <div class="post-summary">NVIDIA&#x27;s NitroGen is an open-source vision-to-action model designed to play video games directly from raw frames using gamepad controls. It is trained through large-scale imitation learning on human gameplay videos and works best on action, platformer, and racing games.</div>
                <div class="key-points">
                    <h4>Key Points</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>NitroGen processes RGB frames through a pre-trained vision transformer (SigLip2) and generates actions using a diffusion matching transformer (DiT).</li>
                        <li>It is trained purely through large-scale imitation learning on videos of human gameplay.</li>
                        <li>The model is most effective on games designed for gamepad controls and less effective on games relying heavily on mouse and keyboard.</li>
                        <li>Potential applications include making couch-coop games playable alone and improving accessibility in gaming.</li>
                        <li>The model is available on Hugging Face for further exploration and use.</li>
