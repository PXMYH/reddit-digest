                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses the practical use of the 4% rule in retirement, revealing that few retirees actually follow it strictly. Instead, most use it as a guideline or theoretical upper limit, often spending much less than 4% annually. Key points include: The 4% rule is more commonly used as a guideline rather than a strict withdrawal strategy. Most retirees spend significantly less than 4% of their starting balance annually. Many retirees adjust their withdrawals based on actual spending needs and portfolio performance. The 4% rule is often seen as a theoretical upper limit for spending. Retirees tend to be conservative in their spending, often working longer than necessary. The consensus among commenters is that the 4% rule is rarely followed strictly. Instead, retirees tend to withdraw based on their actual spending needs, often coming in well under the 4% threshold. The rule is more useful as a planning tool or theoretical limit rather than a practical withdrawal strategy.
