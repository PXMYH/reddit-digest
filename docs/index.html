                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses the possibility of a &#x27;lost decade&#x27; for US equities and whether it should influence investment planning. The discussion highlights the importance of international diversification and the uncertainty of future market performance. Key points include the recommendation for international diversification to mitigate risks associated with high US equity valuations, the correlation between high PE ratios and lower future returns, the unpredictability of market performance suggesting a globally diversified portfolio, the potential benefits of a &#x27;lost decade&#x27; for long-term investors, and the possibility of technological progress boosting market performance. The consensus leans towards the importance of diversification and the acknowledgment of market unpredictability, with many commenters advocating for a globally diversified portfolio as a hedge against potential underperformance in US equities.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses Monte Carlo success rates for those who have achieved FIRE, with the author questioning if a 92% success rate is sufficient given the consequences of failure. The discussion highlights varying perspectives on what constitutes a safe success rate. Key points include: A 92% Monte Carlo success rate may not mean an 8% chance of failure but rather a need for plan adjustments; some suggest considering mortality rates alongside financial success rates; flexibility in budgeting and spending can significantly impact the required success rate; and many financial planners consider success rates above 80% to be sufficient, though individual goals vary. The discussion reveals a consensus that while higher success rates (e.g., 90%+) are often preferred, flexibility in spending and personal circumstances play a crucial role. Some commenters emphasize the importance of balancing financial security with life expectancy and personal goals.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses an experiment where open-source LLMs (OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) were used to play 1,408 games of Civilization V. The LLMs showed slightly better performance in best scores but slightly worse win rates compared to the baseline. The models developed distinct playstyles and could survive full games, marking a significant achievement in AI gaming. Key points include: LLMs played 1,408 full Civilization V games with distinct strategies; OSS-120B favored a warmonger playstyle, while GLM-4.6 was more balanced; Both models preferred the Order ideology over Freedom; The cost per game was approximately $0.86 for OSS-120B; The hybrid approach allowed LLMs to survive full games, a first in AI gaming. The discussion highlights enthusiasm for integrating LLMs into multiplayer games and curiosity about the potential of smaller models. Users expressed interest in playing against local models and exploring more complex AI behaviors.
