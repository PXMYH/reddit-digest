                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses the Monte Carlo success rates that individuals had when they decided to retire early (FIRE). The author, with a 92% success rate, seeks insights from others who have already retired early. Key points include: A 92% Monte Carlo success rate does not imply an 8% failure rate but suggests potential adjustments may be needed. Considering mortality rates alongside financial success rates can provide a more comprehensive view of retirement planning. Flexibility in budgeting, such as cutting luxuries and travel, can significantly impact the feasibility of early retirement. Many Certified Financial Planners (CFPs) consider a success rate above 80% to be sufficient for retirement planning. Individual goals and circumstances vary, making personalized planning essential. The discussion highlights that a high Monte Carlo success rate (e.g., 92%) is generally considered good, but flexibility in spending and personal circumstances play crucial roles. Many commenters suggest that rates above 80% are often deemed sufficient by financial professionals, and considering factors like mortality can provide additional context.
