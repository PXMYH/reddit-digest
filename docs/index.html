                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses the historical context and merits of the S&amp;P 500 (VOO) versus the total US market (VTI), arguing that the choice between the two makes little meaningful difference in long-term returns. It highlights the S&amp;P 500&#x27;s origins and its role as a benchmark, while acknowledging the repetitive nature of the debate in investing communities. Key points include the S&amp;P 500&#x27;s creation in 1926, the insignificance of the choice between VTI and VOO for long-term returns, and the post&#x27;s aim to settle the recurring debate. The discussion highlights a consensus that the choice is not critical, with humorous comments reinforcing this view.

                <div class="post-summary">The user seeks advice on the most optimal GPU setup for local models with at least 48GB VRAM, ideally closer to 96GB, within a budget of $1500-3000 USD in the Shenzhen market. The discussion highlights various GPU options and their value propositions. Key points include the user&#x27;s requirements for high VRAM GPUs, budget constraints, and recommendations such as MI100 for non-CUDA use cases and 4090D 48GB for CUDA support. Other options like A100 40GB, A40s, and 4x 3080 20GB cards are also mentioned, with a focus on cooling and power requirements. The consensus leans towards the MI100 and 4090D 48GB, with additional considerations for cooling and power.
