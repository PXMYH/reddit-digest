                        <li>Inflation-adjusted S&amp;P 500 returns show extended periods of flat or negative performance (e.g., 1968-1994, 2000-2016, 1930-1950).</li>

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses the suitability of VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) as a standalone investment for a 33-year-old with an S&amp;P 500-heavy TSP portfolio. The discussion highlights the simplicity of a &#x27;VT and chill&#x27; approach but also notes potential US market overweight concerns.</div>
                <div class="key-points">

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses an Investopedia article stating that only 3.2% of US retirees have $1 million in retirement accounts, highlighting concerns about retirement savings. The discussion critiques the article&#x27;s methodology and points out that it doesn&#x27;t account for pensions or other retirement income sources. Key points include the low percentage of retirees with $1 million, the article&#x27;s narrow focus on IRA and 401k accounts, and the importance of early and consistent saving. The discussion highlights that the statistic may not fully represent retirees&#x27; financial situations and that the article&#x27;s phrasing could be misleading.

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses a custom framework called &#x27;QKV Core&#x27; that optimizes memory usage for running large language models like Qwen-2.5-7B on low-end GPUs (e.g., GTX 1050 with 4GB VRAM). The framework uses &#x27;Surgical Alignment&#x27; to reduce memory overhead, saving about 44MB per model and improving I/O load times by ~34%.</div>
