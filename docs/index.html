                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses concerns about a potential &#x27;lost decade&#x27; in stock market performance and whether it should influence investment planning. The discussion highlights the importance of international diversification and the limitations of predictive metrics like PE ratios.</div>
                <div class="key-points">
                    <h4>Key Points</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>International diversification is recommended to mitigate risks associated with high US equity valuations.</li>
                        <li>PE ratios are considered meaningful for projecting future returns, but they are not foolproof.</li>
                        <li>Uncertainty is acknowledged, with many commenters advocating for a globally diversified portfolio.</li>
                        <li>The discussion emphasizes that past performance does not guarantee future results.</li>
                        <li>Some commenters critique the methodology of using 10-year averages in PE ratio analysis.</li>

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses Fidelity&#x27;s age-based retirement savings benchmarks, comparing them to the FIRE community&#x27;s 25x expenses rule. Users generally find the benchmarks useful but acknowledge their lack of nuance. Key points include: Fidelity&#x27;s benchmarks range from 1x salary at age 30 to 10x at age 67; the FIRE community&#x27;s 25x expenses rule is compared to Fidelity&#x27;s 10x salary benchmark; users note the benchmarks lack nuance but are useful as general guidelines; the benchmarks assume a standard retirement age and do not account for early retirement; individual circumstances and goals can significantly impact the applicability of these benchmarks. The discussion highlights that Fidelity&#x27;s benchmarks are seen as a good starting point for standard retirement planning but may not apply to those seeking early retirement or with unique financial situations. Users generally agree that while the benchmarks are generic, they serve as useful rules of thumb.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Coasting becomes difficult when financial incentives are removed, leading to a shift in mindset towards early retirement.</li>

                        <li>Coasting is easier when closer to full FIRE, but harder when many years of market returns are still needed.</li>
                        <li>Financial independence can lead to a loss of tolerance for workplace bullshit, making coasting unsustainable.</li>

The comments reflect a mix of opinions, with some advocating for selling crypto due to its speculative nature, while others see it as a small hedge. Key points include the author&#x27;s small crypto allocation, its underperformance, considerations for selling, and the tension between speculative investments and the consistency sought in FIRE strategies. The discussion highlights a general skepticism towards crypto, with many commenters preferring traditional investments like index funds.

                <div class="post-summary">Anthropic&#x27;s blog discusses a new approach to code execution for agents, claiming a 98.7% token reduction, which could significantly benefit local setups by reducing context limits and improving privacy. The approach involves letting models explore tools on demand rather than preloading all tool definitions.</div>
                <div class="key-points">
                    <h4>Key Points</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Anthropic&#x27;s method reduces token usage by 98.7%, making it feasible for local models with smaller context limits.</li>
                        <li>The approach improves privacy by keeping sensitive data out of the model context and flowing directly between tools.</li>
                        <li>Sandboxing is a major challenge for running model-generated code locally.</li>
                        <li>Similar patterns already exist in projects like HF&#x27;s smolagents and Cloudflare&#x27;s independent discovery of &#x27;code mode&#x27;.</li>
                        <li>Some users are experimenting with DAG-based approaches to reduce sandboxing needs.</li>
