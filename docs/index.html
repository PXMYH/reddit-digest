                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses the fear of an AI tech bubble and highlights that despite concerns, the market has grown significantly over the past two years. It emphasizes the importance of staying invested to avoid missing out on growth periods. Key points include: the market has grown significantly (VTI up 42%, VOO up 47%) despite AI bubble fears; staying out of the market means missing both bad and good times; it&#x27;s possible the AI bubble is already popping, but the market may still rise; historical context shows Greenspan&#x27;s &#x27;irrational exuberance&#x27; warning preceded years of market growth; and uncertainty remains about future market movements. The discussion highlights the uncertainty around market bubbles and the importance of long-term investing, with many commenters agreeing that while corrections are possible, staying invested is crucial to capture growth periods.

Key points include: Taxes are currently at historical lows and could increase in the future; Future tax rates are uncertain, similar to market predictions; Some retirees have experienced lower taxes in retirement compared to their working years; The national deficit and debt may influence future tax policies; Roth conversions and RMD strategies are discussed as potential tax planning tools. The discussion highlights a mix of opinions, with some expecting higher taxes due to economic factors like the national deficit, while others emphasize the unpredictability of future tax rates. There is a consensus on the importance of saving and strategic tax planning, such as Roth conversions, to manage retirement withdrawals.
