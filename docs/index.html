                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post compares a Buy-&amp;-Hold investment strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings when economic anxiety peaks (measured by Google trends for &#x27;recession&#x27;) and moves into short-term treasuries. The analysis shows that while the Fear-Based strategy performs slightly better in a tax-free scenario, the difference in annual returns is minimal, and the Buy-&amp;-Hold strategy outperforms when considering capital gains taxes.</div>
                <div class="key-points">
                    <h4>Key Points</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Fear-Based strategy outperforms Buy-&amp;-Hold in a tax-free scenario but underperforms when considering capital gains taxes.</li>
                        <li>The difference in annual returns between the two strategies is less than 1% in a tax-free account.</li>
                        <li>The Fear-Based strategy significantly reduces maximum drawdown compared to Buy-&amp;-Hold.</li>
                        <li>The analysis is based on back-testing over the same period used to develop the strategy, which may introduce bias.</li>
                        <li>The practical implementation of the Fear-Based strategy is challenging due to timing and emotional factors.</li>

There is a consensus that while the Fear-Based strategy shows some benefits, the practical difficulties and minimal return differences make Buy-&amp;-Hold a more reliable approach for long-term investors.</p>

                <div class="post-summary">A 36-year-old Reddit user shares their experience of losing half their savings (from $75k to $37k) due to rash options trading decisions. They seek advice on how to financially and mentally recover from this significant setback. Key points include: the user lost half their savings due to poor options trading decisions, they are struggling emotionally and financially after the loss, the community advises treating the loss as an expensive lesson and focusing on long-term, disciplined investing, recommendations include budgeting, living below one&#x27;s means, and investing in index funds or a 3-fund portfolio, and there is no quick way to recover; it will take time and disciplined saving. The community consensus emphasizes learning from the mistake, avoiding speculative trading, and adopting a disciplined, long-term investment approach. Key advice includes budgeting, living below one&#x27;s means, and focusing on index funds or a 3-fund portfolio for retirement.

                <div class="post-summary">Researchers used open-source LLMs (GPT-OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) to play 1,408 full games of Civilization V with a hybrid approach, achieving survival rates comparable to the in-game AI. The LLMs developed distinct playstyles, with OSS-120B favoring warmonger strategies and GLM-4.6 adopting a more balanced approach. The cost per game was approximately $0.86, with input tokens scaling linearly as the game progressed. Key points include: LLMs played 1,408 full Civilization V games with a hybrid approach, achieving survival rates of ~97.5%; OSS-120B favored warmonger strategies, while GLM-4.6 adopted a balanced approach; Both models preferred the Order ideology (~24% more likely) over Freedom; Cost per game was ~$0.86, with input tokens scaling linearly; The study highlights the potential of LLMs in complex strategy games. The discussion highlights enthusiasm for integrating LLMs into multiplayer games and curiosity about the potential of smaller models. Users expressed interest in playing against local models and exploring more complex AI behaviors.
