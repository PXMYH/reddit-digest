Many commenters share positive experiences of living in the Czech Republic and suggest that $6M is more than enough for a comfortable life there. Some also emphasize the importance of personal preference in choosing a retirement location.

                <div class="post-summary">Researchers used open-source LLMs (GPT-OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) to play 1,408 full Civilization V games, finding that LLMs can survive as long as the game goes and develop distinct playstyles. The models showed slight improvements in best scores but minor decreases in win rates compared to baseline AI. Key points include: LLMs can survive full Civilization V games with a hybrid approach, achieving ~97.5% survival rate; OSS-120B favored a warmonger playstyle with more Domination victories, while GLM-4.6 played more balanced; Both models preferred the Order ideology (~24% more likely) over Freedom; Cost per game was ~$0.86 for OSS-120B, with input tokens scaling linearly as the game progresses; The study suggests that even smaller models (e.g., OSS-20B) can perform adequately in this hybrid setup. The discussion highlights excitement about the potential of LLMs in gaming, curiosity about playing against local models, and questions about the implications of model size on performance. Some users expressed interest in how LLMs might adapt to civilization leaders&#x27; personas.
