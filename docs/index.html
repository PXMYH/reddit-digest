Many users share their experiences and opinions on whether they expect to receive an inheritance and the uncertainties surrounding it. Key points include: never expect an inheritance even if promised one due to uncertainties like medical costs and bad investments; elder care expenses can significantly reduce or eliminate expected inheritances; some view the absence of student loans as a form of inheritance; it is unwise to count on an inheritance unless it has already been received; and personal experiences vary widely, with some receiving minimal or no inheritance. The discussion highlights a consensus that expecting an inheritance is risky and often unrealistic, with many users sharing personal stories of how expected inheritances were reduced or eliminated due to various factors like elder care costs and bad investments. There is a general agreement that financial planning should not rely on potential inheritances.

                <div class="post-summary">The ik_llama.cpp project has achieved a significant performance breakthrough for multi-GPU setups, delivering a 3x to 4x speed improvement in local LLM inference. This advancement allows for the utilization of multiple low-cost GPUs instead of expensive high-end cards, making it a game-changer for homelabs, server rooms, and cloud setups. Key points include the introduction of a new execution mode (split mode graph) for multi-GPU configurations, consistent 2x prompt processing speeds even on single GPU or CPU-only setups, and performance improvements rivaling other optimized frameworks like exllama and vllm. The community is highly enthusiastic about the performance gains, with many users confirming the speed improvements on various setups. There is a consensus that ik_llama.cpp is a fantastic fork with substantial benefits over the original llama.cpp, though some users have noted bottlenecks in hybrid inference setups.
