                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post compares a Buy-&amp;-Hold strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings when economic anxiety peaks (measured by Google Trends for &#x27;recession&#x27;). The analysis shows that while the Fear-Based strategy outperforms slightly in a tax-free scenario, the difference diminishes with taxes, and the Buy-&amp;-Hold strategy remains robust. Key points include the impact of taxes on the Fear-Based strategy, significant reduction in max drawdown, and the psychological challenges of executing such a strategy. The discussion highlights the importance of considering taxes and psychological factors in investment strategies, with commenters praising the analysis but cautioning against over-reliance on back-tested strategies.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses the fear of an AI tech bubble and highlights that despite concerns, the market has grown significantly over the past two years. It emphasizes the importance of staying invested to avoid missing out on growth periods. Key points include: The market has grown significantly (VTI up 42%, VOO up 47%) despite AI bubble fears. Staying out of the market means missing both bad and good times. It&#x27;s possible the AI bubble is already popping, but the market may still rise. Historical context: Greenspan&#x27;s &#x27;irrational exuberance&#x27; warning preceded years of market growth. Uncertainty remains about future market movements. The discussion highlights the uncertainty around market bubbles and the importance of long-term investing. Many commenters agree that while corrections are possible, staying invested is crucial to capture growth periods.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses an experiment where open-source LLMs (OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) were used to play 1,408 games of Civilization V. The LLMs showed slightly better performance in best scores but slightly worse win rates compared to the baseline AI. Notably, the LLMs developed distinct playstyles and could survive full games, a feat not achieved by pure-LLM or pure-RL approaches. Key points include: LLMs played 1,408 full Civilization V games with distinct strategies; OSS-120B favored a warmonger playstyle, while GLM-4.6 was more balanced; Both models preferred the Order ideology over Freedom; Cost per game was approximately $0.86 for OSS-120B; LLMs could survive full games, unlike previous pure-LLM or pure-RL approaches. The discussion highlights enthusiasm for integrating LLMs into multiplayer games and curiosity about the potential of smaller models. Comments also reflect interest in the broader implications of AI in gaming and the uniqueness of the approach.

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses the current state of sparse-MoE models for agentic coding tasks, with mixed opinions on their effectiveness and comparisons to other models like GPT-OSS-120B and Qwen3-Next 80B. Key points include: Evaluation methods for sparse-MoE models are questioned. GPT-OSS-120B is noted for its limitations in long-context tasks despite adjustments. GPT-OSS-120B is considered superior to most models listed, with Qwen3-Next 80B as a potential exception. Performance breakdowns are observed in models like Roo Code beyond 64K context. Community opinions vary on the effectiveness of these models for agentic tasks. The discussion highlights concerns about evaluation methods and the practical limitations of models like GPT-OSS-120B in long-context scenarios. There is a consensus that while GPT-OSS-120B is strong, other models like Qwen3-Next 80B may offer competitive performance.
