                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses the author&#x27;s confusion about why ETFs are more frequently mentioned than mutual funds in investment discussions, despite their similarities. The discussion highlights the differences in trading flexibility, fees, and accessibility between ETFs and mutual funds. Key points include: ETFs can be traded in real-time during market hours, while mutual funds are traded at the end of the day; ETFs are generally more accessible across different brokers, making them easier to recommend; mutual funds may have behavioral advantages by discouraging frequent trading; ETFs often have lower fees compared to mutual funds; and both ETFs and mutual funds offer diversification and cost-effective investment options. The consensus in the discussion is that while ETFs and mutual funds are similar in many ways, ETFs are more popular due to their trading flexibility, lower fees, and broader accessibility. However, mutual funds may offer behavioral benefits by reducing the temptation to trade frequently.

                <div class="post-summary">The post questions whether the Bogleheads investment philosophy remains valid in a potentially changing world order, such as the dissolution of NATO or shifts in global power dynamics. The discussion highlights the philosophy&#x27;s focus on broad market exposure and long-term investing, regardless of geopolitical changes. Key points include the philosophy&#x27;s historical success in a stable post-WW2 world order, its emphasis on broad market exposure and passive investing, and the consensus that geopolitical changes may not invalidate its core principles. The discussion leans towards maintaining a global investment approach despite potential world order shifts, emphasizing global diversification and avoiding attempts to predict or react to geopolitical changes.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses strategies for contributing exactly the 401K limit of $24,500, especially when dealing with variable bonuses and employer matching. Users share tips on how to manage contributions to avoid missing out on employer matches. Key points include: Employer contributions do not count toward the $24,500 limit; some employers offer &#x27;true up&#x27; to cover missed matches if you overshoot the limit; without &#x27;true up,&#x27; frequent adjustments are needed to hit the contribution limit accurately; payroll systems often automatically stop deductions at the limit; and after-tax contributions can be rolled over into a Roth for additional retirement planning. The discussion highlights the importance of understanding employer policies like &#x27;true up&#x27; and the distinction between employee and employer contribution limits. Users agree that frequent recalculations and adjustments are necessary if &#x27;true up&#x27; is not available, and some suggest dividing the limit by the number of pay periods for easier management.

                <div class="post-summary">The post argues that choosing between VTI (total US market fund) and VOO (S&amp;P 500 fund) makes little meaningful difference in long-term returns, despite being a frequently debated topic in investing communities. Key points include the historical context of the S&amp;P 500, the statistical similarity in returns between the two funds, and the overemphasis on the choice. The discussion consensus is that the choice is largely inconsequential, with many commenters emphasizing that either option is sufficient for long-term investing.

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post compares a Buy-&amp;-Hold strategy with a Fear-Based strategy that sells SPY holdings when economic anxiety peaks (measured by Google trends for &#x27;recession&#x27;) and moves into short-term treasuries. The analysis shows that while the Fear-Based strategy performs slightly better in a tax-free scenario, the difference is minimal, and the Buy-&amp;-Hold strategy is more beneficial when considering taxes and long-term investing. Key points include the Fear-Based strategy outperforming Buy-&amp;-Hold in a tax-free scenario but underperforming when taxes are considered, reducing maximum drawdown significantly, and relying on back-tested data. The discussion highlights concerns about the practicality of the Fear-Based strategy, including the challenge of timing the market accurately and the emotional difficulty of executing such a strategy during turbulent times. Many commenters emphasize the benefits of a long-term Buy-&amp;-Hold approach, especially for investors decades away from retirement.

                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses where to retire on a $100k/year dividend income, focusing on maximizing quality of life and stretching dollars. The discussion includes both international and domestic options, with a mix of opinions on staying put versus exploring new locations. Key points include preferences for staying near family and friends, suggestions for international locations like China, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia for cost-effectiveness, recommendations to travel to multiple places before deciding, questions about the portfolio size needed for $100k dividend income, and consideration of domestic options in the US. The discussion highlights a divide between those who prefer to stay in their current location for personal reasons and those who suggest exploring international or domestic options for better cost of living and experiences. There is no clear consensus, but the importance of personal preferences and visiting multiple places before deciding is emphasized.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses the challenge of dealing with the daily grind of work when one is not yet financially independent enough to retire early (FIRE) but also lacks the motivation to push harder at work. The author seeks advice on how to stay motivated and keep their spirits up during this phase. Key points include the author feeling stuck in a repetitive, low-effort job with little motivation to advance, commenters emphasizing making the most of the current years rather than just waiting for FIRE, some expressing a desire for a severance package or early retirement, others sharing feelings of being close to FIRE but still struggling with the grind, and a common sentiment of doing the bare minimum while maintaining job expectations. The discussion highlights a mix of coping strategies, including making life less about work, hoping for a severance package, and doing the bare minimum while maintaining job performance. There is a consensus on the importance of finding ways to enjoy the present rather than just waiting for financial independence.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses the use of abliteration to reduce &#x27;slop&#x27; (flowery, cliched language) in LLM outputs, specifically applied to the Mistral Nemo model. The author successfully created a slop-reduced LLM using abliteration without fine-tuning, demonstrating the technique&#x27;s potential. Key points include: Abliteration can reduce &#x27;slop&#x27; in LLM outputs without training; the technique was applied to Mistral Nemo, showing semantic separation between layers 7 and 10; a slop-reduced LLM was created using abliteration alone, taking 2.5 hours on an A6000; community feedback includes both positive and critical views on the effectiveness and impact on prose quality; GGUF versions of the model were created and shared by a community member. The discussion highlights mixed opinions on the effectiveness of the technique, with some users appreciating the reduction in slop while others feel it makes the prose too dry or lacks imagination. There is also interest in whether the technique can be applied to other patterns beyond slop.

                <div class="post-summary">The post discusses an experiment where open-source LLMs (OSS-120B and GLM-4.6) were used to play 1,408 full games of Civilization V. The LLMs showed slightly better performance in best scores but slightly worse win rates compared to the baseline. Notably, the LLMs developed distinct playstyles and could survive full games, a feat not achieved by pure-LLM or pure-RL approaches. Key points include: LLMs played 1,408 full Civilization V games with distinct playstyles; OSS-120B favored a warmonger strategy, while GLM-4.6 was more balanced; Both models preferred the Order ideology over Freedom; The cost per game was approximately $0.86 for OSS-120B; LLMs could survive full games, unlike pure-LLM or pure-RL approaches. The discussion highlights enthusiasm for integrating LLMs into multiplayer games and curiosity about the potential of smaller models. Comments also express interest in playing against local models and exploring quasi-multi-level ABMs for unit decisions.
