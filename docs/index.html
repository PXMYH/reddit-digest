                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post discusses how cloud inference companies manage to offer services at low costs despite high GPU and electricity expenses. The discussion highlights various strategies like batching, scaling, and quantization, but also questions the actual profitability of these companies. Key points include: Batching allows one GPU to serve hundreds of users simultaneously; many companies may not be profitable yet, relying on future projections; scale, batching, and quantization improve efficiency; and some companies operate at a loss, hoping to outlast competitors. The discussion highlights the efficiency gains from batching and scaling, but also reveals skepticism about the current profitability of cloud inference companies. There is a consensus that while these companies use advanced techniques to reduce costs, many are still operating at a loss.
