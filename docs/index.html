                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post questions whether it&#x27;s common for tech professionals in their 30s to have $3M in savings, with mixed responses from commenters. Some argue it&#x27;s rare, while others provide anecdotes or data suggesting it&#x27;s possible, especially in high-paying tech roles or with early stock options. Key points include the author&#x27;s question, varied responses from commenters, data from levels.fyi showing high compensation in tech, mentions of early stock options (RSUs), and anecdotes like a 47-year-old with $4M after 14 years at a FAANG company. The discussion highlights a divide in opinions, with some dismissing the idea of $3M savings as normal, while others acknowledge it&#x27;s possible, especially in high-paying tech roles or with early stock options. The consensus leans towards it being an outlier rather than the norm, with anecdotes and data supporting both sides.
