                <div class="post-summary">The post is a request for community testing of a new autoparser mechanism for llama.cpp, designed to replace the existing chat parsers with a more efficient layered approach. The author has tested it extensively but seeks additional feedback to identify bugs. Key points include: The autoparser aims to handle 95%+ of typical chat templates for models. Only Ministral and GPT-OSS models currently require dedicated parsers. The author encourages testing with coding agents that use tool calls, such as OpenCode and Roo. Bug reports should be directed to a specific GitHub repository. The community discussion includes questions about regression tests and a list of tested models. Discussion highlights include a humorous comment about AI disclosure, a question about regression tests, and a request for a list of tested models. The overall consensus appears supportive of the effort.
