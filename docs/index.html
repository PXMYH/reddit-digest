                <div class="post-summary">The Reddit post highlights that the concept of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) is still relatively unknown to most people, as demonstrated by a colleague&#x27;s surprise at the possibility of retiring in one&#x27;s late 30s. The post emphasizes the power of compounding and the impact of saving a significant portion of one&#x27;s income. Key points include: FIRE is an obscure concept to many people outside specific circles like tech and finance; the power of compounding and saving 20-25% of income can significantly reduce the timeline to financial freedom; many people are financially illiterate or indifferent to the idea of early retirement; retiring in one&#x27;s late 30s is considered outside the norm for most people; spreading awareness about FIRE can potentially change lives, though it&#x27;s often met with surprise or disbelief. The discussion highlights a consensus that FIRE is not widely understood or considered feasible by the general population. Many commenters note that financial literacy and the ability to save significant portions of income are major barriers. There is also a recognition that FIRE is more commonly discussed in certain professional circles, such as tech and finance.
